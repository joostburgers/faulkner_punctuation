from a little after two oclock until almost sundown of the long still hot weary dead september afternoon they sat in what miss coldfield still called the office because her father had called it that p a dim hot airless room with the blinds all closed and fastened for fortypthree summers because when she was a girl someone had believed that light and moving air carried heat and that dark was always coolerp and which pas the sun shone fuller and fuller on that side of the housep became latticed with yellow slashes full of dust motes which quentin thought of as being flecks of the dead old dried

sparrows came now and then in random gustsp making a dry vivid dusty sound before going awayp and opposite quentinp miss coldfield in the eternal black which she had worn for fortypthree years nowp whether for sisterp fatherp or nothusband none knewp sitting so bolt upright in the straight hard chair that was so tall for her that her legs hung straight and rigid as if she had iron shinbones and anklesp clear of the floor with that air of impotent and static rage like childrenps feetp and talking in that grim haggard amazed voice until at last listening would renege and hearingpsense selfpconfound and the longpdead object of her impotent yet indomitable frustration would appearp as though by outraged recapitulation evokedp quiet inattentive and harmlessp out of the biding and dreamy and victorious dustp her voice would not ceasep it would just vanishp there would be the dim coffinpsmelling gloom sweet and oversweet with the twicepbloomed wistaria against the outer wall by the savage quiet september sun impacted distilled and hyperdistilledp into which came now and then the loud cloudy flutter of the sparrows like a flat limber stick whipped by an idle boyp and the rank smell of female old flesh long embattled in virginity while the wan haggard face watched him above the faint triangle of lace at wrists and throat from the too tall chair in which she resembled a crucified childp and the voice not ceasing but vanishing into and then out of the long intervals like a streamp a trickle running from patch to patch of dried sandp and the ghost mused with shadowy docility as if it were the voice which he haunted where a more fortunate one would have had a housep out of quiet thunderclap he would abrupt pmanphorsepdemonp upon a scene peaceful and decorous as a

architect huddled quietlyp carrying in bloodless paradox the shovels and picks and axes of peaceful conquestp then in the long unamaze quentin seemed to watch them overrun suddenly the hundred square miles of tranquil and astonished earth and drag house and formal gardens violently out of the soundless nothing and clap them down like cards upon a table beneath the upppalm immobile and pontificp

young manp so maybe you will enter the literary profession as so many southern gentlemen and gentlewomen too are doing now and maybe some day you will remember this and write about itp you will be married then i expect and perhaps your wife will want a new gown or a new chair for the house and you can write this and submit it to the magazinesp perhaps you will even remember kindly then the old woman who made you spend a whole afternoon sitting indoors and listening while she talked about people and events you were fortunate enough to escape yourself when you wanted to be out among young friends of your own agepp pyessumpp quentin saidp only she dont mean that he thoughtp itps because she wants it toldp it was still early thenp he had yet in his pocket the note which he had received by the hand of a small negro boy just before noonp asking him to call and see her p the quaintp stiffly formal request which was actually a summonsp out of another world almost p the queer archaic sheet of ancient good notepaper written over with the neat faded cramped script whichp due to his astonishment at the request from a woman three times his age and whom he had known all his life without having exchanged a hundred words with her or perhaps to the fact that he was only twenty years oldp he did not recognise as revealing a character coldp implacablep and even ruthlessp he obeyed it immediately after the noon mealp walking the half mile between his home and hers through the dry dusty heat of early september and so into the house pit too somehow smaller than its actual size p it was of two storeys p unpainted and a little shabbyp yet with an airp a quality of grim endurance as though like her it had been created to fit into and complement a world in all ways a little smaller than the one in which it found itselfp where in the gloom of the shuttered hallway whose air was even hotter than outsidep as if there were prisoned in it like in a tomb all the suspiration of slow heatpladen time which had recurred during the fortypthree yearsp the small figure in black which did not even rustlep the wan triangle of lace at wrists and throatp the dim face looking at him with an expression speculativep urgentp and intentp waited to invite him inp itps because she wants it told he thought so that people whom she will never see and whose names she will never hear and who have never heard her name nor seen her face will read it and know at last why god let us lose the warp that only through the blood of our men and the tears of our women could he stay this demon and efface his name and lineage from the earthp then almost immediately he decided that neither was this the reason why she had sent the notep and sending itp why to himp since if she had merely wanted it toldp written and even printedp she would not have needed to call in anybody p a woman who even in his pquentinpsp fatherps youth had already established peven if not affirmedp herself as the townps and the countyps poetess laureate by issuing to the stern and meagre subscription list of the county newspaper poemsp ode eulogy and epitaphp out of some bitter and implacable reserve of

that he would be lying about who and where and why he came from by the very fact that apparently he had to refuse to say at allp and the very fact that he had had to choose respectability to hide behind was proof enough pif anyone needed further proofp that what he fled from must have been some opposite of respectability too dark to talk aboutp because he was too youngp he was just twentypfive

p all in a thunder and a fury of wildeyed horses and of galloping and of dustp pohp there were plenty of them to abet himp assist himp make a race of itp ten oclock on sunday morningp the carriage racing on two wheels up to the very door to the church with that wild negro in his christian clothes looking exactly like a performing tiger in a linen duster and a top hatp and ellen with no drop of blood in her facep holding those two children who were not crying and who did not need to be heldp who sat on either side of her perfectly still toop with in their faces that infantile enormity which we did not then quite comprehendp oh yesp there were plenty to aid and abet himp even he could not have held a horse race without someone to race againstp because it was not even public opinion that stopped himp not even the men who might have had wives and children in carriages to be ridden down and into ditchesp it was the minister himselfp speaking in the name of the women of jefferson and yoknapatawpha countyp so he quit coming to church himselfp now it would be just ellen and the children in the carriage on sunday morningp so we knew now that at least there would be no betting nowp since no one could say if it was an actual race or notp since nowp with his face absentp it was only the wild negrops perfectly inscrutable one with the teeth glinting a littlep so that now we could never know if it were a race or a runawayp and if there was triumphp it was on the face twelve miles back there at sutpenps hundredp which did not even require to see or be presentp it was the negro nowp who in the act of passing another carriage spoke to that team too as well as to his own p something without wordsp not needing words probablyp in that tongue in which they slept in the mud of that swamp and brought here out of whatever dark swamp he had found them in and brought them herep p the dustp the thunderp the carriage whirling up to the church door while women and children scattered and screamed before it and men caught at the bridles of the other teamp and the negro would let ellen and the children out at the door and take the carriage on around to the hitching grove

papa and i entered those gates that afternoon and began to go up the drive toward the housep i could feel itp it was as though somewhere in that sunday afternoonps quiet and peace the screams of that child still existedp lingeredp not as sound now but as something for the skin to hearp the hair on the head to hearp but i did not ask at oncep i was just four thenp i sat in the buggy beside papa as i had stood between him and our aunt before the church on that first sunday when i had been dressed to come and see my sister and my nephew and niece for the first timep looking at the house pi had been inside it before toop of coursep but even when i saw it for the first time that i could remember i seemed already to know how it was going to look just as i seemed to know how ellen and judith and henry would look before i saw them for the time which i always remember as being the firstpp nop not asking even thenp but just looking at that huge quiet housep saying pwhat room is judith sick inp papapp with that quiet aptitude of a child for accepting the inexplicablep though i now know that even then i was wondering what judith saw when she came out the door and found the phaeton instead of the carriagep the tame stableboy instead of the wild manp what she had seen in that phaeton which looked so innocent to the rest of us p or worsep what she had missed when she saw the phaeton and began to screamp yesp a still hot quiet sunday afternoon like this afternoonp i remember yet the utter quiet of that house when we went in and from which i knew at once that he was absent without knowing that he would now be in the scuppernong arbor drinking with wash jonesp i only knewp as soon as papa and i crossed the thresholdp that he was not therep as though with some almost omniscient conviction pthat same instinctive knowledge which enabled me to tell ellen that it was not from him that judith would need protectionp knowing that he did not need to stay and observe his triumph p and thatp in comparison with what was to bep this one was a mere trivial business even beneath our notice toop yesp that quiet darkened room with the blinds closed and a negro woman sitting beside the bed with a fan and judithps white face on the pillow beneath a camphor clothp asleep as i supposed thenp possibly it was sleepp or would be called sleepp and ellenps face white and calm and papa said pgo out and find henry and ask him to play with youp rosap and so i stood just outside that quiet door in that quiet upper hall because i was afraid to go away even from it because i could hear the sabbath afternoon quiet of that house louder than thunderp louder than laughing even with triumphp p pthink of the childrenpp papa saidp p pthinkpp ellen saidp pwhat else do i dop what else do i lie awake at night and do but think of thempp neither papa nor ellen said come back homep nop this occurred before it became fashionable to repair your mistakes by turning your back on them and runningp it was just the two quiet voices beyond that blank door which might have been discussing something printed in a magazinep and ip a child standing close beside that door because i was afraid to be there but more afraid to leave itp standing motionless beside that door as though trying to make myself blend with the dark wood and become invisiblep like a chameleonp listening to the living spiritp presencep of that housep since some of ellenps life and breath had now gone into it as well as hisp breathing away in a long neutral sound of victory and despairp of triumph and terror toop p pdo you love this p  p pp papa saidp p ppapapp ellen saidp that was allp but i could see her face then as clearly as papa could havep with that same expression which it had worn in the carriage on that first sunday and the othersp then a servant came and said our buggy was readyp pyesp from themselvesp not from himp not from anybodyp just as nobody could have saved themp even himselfp because he now showed us why that triumph had been beneath his noticep he showed ellenp that isp not ip i was not therep it was six years nowp during which i had scarcely seen himp our aunt was gone now and i was keeping house for papap perhaps once a year papa and i would go out there and have dinnerp and maybe four times a year ellen and the children would come in and spend the day with usp not hep that i know ofp he never entered this house again after he and ellen marriedp i was young thenp i was even young enough to believe that this was due to some stubborn coal of consciencep if not remorsep even in himp but i know better nowp i know now that it was simply because since papa had given him respectability through a wife there was nothing else he could want from papa and so not even sheer gratitudep let alone appearancesp could force him to forego his own pleasure to the extent of taking a family meal with his wifeps peoplep so i saw little of themp i did not have time now to playp even if i had ever had any inclinationp i had never learned how and i saw no reason to try to learn now even if i had had the timep pso it was six years nowp though it was actually no secret to ellen since it had apparently been going on ever since he drove the last nail in the housep the only difference between now and the time of his bachelorhood being that now they would hitch the teams and saddle horses and mules in the grove beyond the stable and so come up across the pasture unseen from the housep because there were plenty of them stillp it was as if god or the devil had taken advantage of his very vices in order to supply witnesses to the discharge of our curse not only from among gentlefolksp our own kindp but from the very scum and riffraff who could not have approached the house itself under any other circumstancesp not even from the rearp yesp ellen and those two children alone in that house twelve miles from townp and down there in the stable a hollow square of faces in the lantern lightp the white faces on three sidesp the black ones on the fourthp and in the center two of his wild negroes fightingp nakedp fighting not like white men fightp with rules and weaponsp but like negroes fight to hurt one another quick and badp ellen knew thatp or thought she didp that was not itp she accepted that p not reconciledp accepted p as though there is a breathingppoint in outrage where you can accept it almost with gratitude since you can say to yourselfp thank god this is allp at least i now know all of it p thinking thatp clinging still to that when she ran into the stable that night while the very men who had stolen into it from the rear fell back away from her with at least some grain of decencyp and ellen seeing not the two black beasts she had expected to see but instead a white one and a black onep both naked to the waist and gouging at one anotherps eyes as if their skins should not only have been the same color but should have been covered with fur toop yesp it seems that on certain occasionsp perhaps at the end of the eveningp the spectaclep as a grand finale or perhaps as a matter of sheer deadly forethought toward the retention of supremacyp dominationp he would enter the ring with one of the negroes himselfp yesp that is what ellen sawp her husband and the father of her children standing there naked and panting and bloody to the waist and the negro just fallen evidentlyp lying at his feet and bloody too save that on the negro it merely looked like grease or sweat p ellen running down the hill from the housep bareheadedp in time to hear the soundp the screamingp hearing it while she still ran in the darkness and before the spectators knew that she was therep hearing it even before it occurred to one spectator to sayp pitps a horsep then pitps a womanp then pmy godp itps a childp p ran inp and the spectators falling back to permit her to see henry plunge out from among the negroes who had been holding himp screaming and vomiting p not pausingp not even looking at the faces which shrank back away from her as she knelt in the stable filth to raise henry and not looking at henry either but up at him as he stood there with even his teeth showing beneath his beard now and another negro wiping the blood from his body with a towsackp pi know you will excuse usp gentlemenpp ellen saidp but they were already departingp nigger and whitep slinking out again as they had slunk inp and ellen not watching them now either but kneeling in the dirt while henry clung to herp cryingp and he standing there yet while a third nigger prodded his shirt or coat at him as though the coat were a stick and he a caged snakep pwhere is judithp thomaspp ellen saidp p pjudithpp he saidp ohp he was not lyingp his own triumph had outrun himp he had builded even better in evil than even he could have hopedp pjudithp isnpt she in bedpp p pdont lie to mep thomaspp ellen saidp pi can understand your bringing

therep i was not there to see the two sutpen faces this time p once on judith and once on the negro girl beside her p looking down through the square entrance to the loftpp it was a summer of wistariap the twilight was full of it and of the smell of his fatherps cigar as they sat on the front gallery after supper until it would be time for quentin to startp while in the deep shaggy lawn below the veranda the fireflies blew and drifted in soft random p the odorp the scentp which five months later mr compsonps letter would carry up from mississippi and over the long iron new england snow and into quentinps sittingproom at harvardp it was a day of listening too p the listeningp the hearing in 1909 even yet mostly that which he already knew since he had been born in and still breathed the same air in which the church bells had rung on that sunday morning in 1833 pandp on sundaysp heard even one of the original three bells in the same steeple where descendants of the same pigeons strutted and crooned or wheeled in short courses resembling soft fluid paintpsmears on the soft summer skypp p a sunday morning in june with the bells ringing peaceful and peremptory and a little cacophonous p the denominations in concord though not in tune p and the ladies and childrenp and house negroes to carry the parasols and flywhisksp and even a few men pthe ladies moving in hoops among the miniature broadcloth of little boys and the pantalettes of little girlsp in the skirts of the time when ladies did not walk but floatedp when the other men sitting with their feet on the railing of the holston house gallery looked upp and there the stranger wasp he was already halfway across the square when they saw himp on a big hardpridden roan horsep man and beast looking as though they had been created out of thin air and set down in the bright summer sabbath sunshine in the middle of a tired foxtrot p face and horse that none of them had ever seen beforep name that none of them had ever heardp and origin and purpose which some of them were never to learnp so that in the next four weeks pjefferson was a village thenp the holston housep the courthousep six storesp a blacksmith and livery stablep a saloon frequented by drovers and peddlersp three churches and perhaps thirty residencesp the strangerps name went back and forth among the places of business and of idleness and among the residences in steady strophe and antistrophep sutpenp sutpenp sutpenp sutpenp that was all that the town was to know about him for almost a monthp he had apparently come into town from the south p a man of about twentypfive as the town learned laterp because at the time his age could not have been guessed because at that time he looked like a man who had been sickp not like a man who had been peacefully ill in bed and had recovered to move with a sort of diffident and tentative amazement in a world which he had believed himself on the point of surrenderingp but like a man who had been through some solitary furnace experience which was more than just feverp like an explorer sayp who not only had to face the normal hardship of the pursuit which he chose but was overtaken by the added and unforeseen handicap of the fever also and fought through it at enormous cost not so much physical as mentalp alone and unaided and not through blind instinctive will to endure and survive but to gain and keep to enjoy it the material prize for which he accepted the original gambitp a man with a big frame but gaunt now almost to emaciationp with a short reddish beard which resembled a disguise and above which his pale eyes had a quality at once visionary and alertp ruthless and reposed in a face whose flesh had the appearance of potteryp of having been colored by that ovenps fever either of soul or environmentp deeper than sun alone beneath a dead impervious surface as of glazed clayp that was what they sawp though it was years before the town learned that that was all which he possessed at the time p the strong spent horse and the clothes on his back and a small saddlebag scarcely large enough to contain the spare linen and the razorsp and the two pistols of which miss coldfield told quentinp with the butts worn smooth as pickhandles and which he used with the precision of knitting needlesp later quentinps grandfather saw him ride at a canter around a sapling at twenty feet and put both bullets into a playing card fastened to the treep he had a room in the holston house but he carried the key with him and each morning he fed and saddled the horse and rode away before daylightp where to the town likewise failed to learnp probably due to the fact that he gave the pistol demonstration on the third day after his arrivalp so they had to depend on inquiry to find out what they could about himp which would of necessity be at nightp at the supper table in the holston house dining room or in the lounge which he would have to cross to gain his room and lock the door againp which he would do as soon as he finished eatingp the bar opened into the lounge toop and that would or should have been the place to accost him and even inquirep except for the fact that he did not use the barp he did not drink at allp he told themp he did not say that he used to drink and had quitp nor that he had never used alcoholp he just said that he would not care for a drinkp it was years later before even quentinps grandfather phe was a young man too thenp it would be years yet before he would become general compsonp learned that the reason sutpen did not drink was that he did not have the money with which to pay his share or return the courtesyp it was general compson who first realized that at this time sutpen lacked not only the money to spend for drink and convivialityp but the time and inclination as wellp that he was at this time completely the slave of his secret and furious impatiencep his conviction gained from whatever that recent experience had been p that fever mental or physical p of a need for hastep of time fleeing beneath himp which was to drive him for the next five years p as general compson computed itp roughly until about nine months before his son was bornp so they would catch himp run him to earthp in the lounge between the supper table and his locked door to give him the opportunity to tell them who he was and where he came from and what he was up top whereupon he would move gradually and steadily until his back came in contact with something p a post or a wall p and then stand there and tell them nothing whatever as pleasantly and courteously as a hotel clerkp it was the chickasaw indian agent with or through whom he dealt and so it was not until he waked the county recorder that saturday night with the deedp patentp to the land and the gold spanish coinp that the town learned that he now owned a hundred square miles of some of the best virgin bottom land in the countryp though even that knowledge came too late because sutpen himself was gonep where to again they did not knowp but he owned land among them now and some of them began to suspect what general compson apparently knewp that the spanish coin with which he had paid to have his patent recorded was the last one of any kind which he possessedp so they were certain now that he had departed to get morep there were several who even anticipated in believing pand even in saying aloudp now that he was not presentp what sutpenps future and then unborn sisterpinplaw was to tell quentin almost eighty years laterp that he had found some unique and practical way of hiding loot and that he had returned to the cache to replenish his pocketsp even if he had not actually ridden with the two pistols back to the river and the steamboats full of gamblers and cottonp and slavedealers to replenish the cachep at least some of them were telling one another that when two months later he returnedp again without warning and accompanied this time by the covered wagon with a negro driving it and on the seat with the negro a smallp alertly resigned man with a grimp harried latin facep in a frock coat and a flowered waistcoat and a hat which would have created no furore on a paris boulevardp all of which he was to wear constantly for the next two years p the sombrely theatric clothing and the expression of fatalistic and amazed determination p while his white client and the negro crew which he was to advise though not direct went stark naked save for a coating of dried mudp this was the french architectp years later the town learned that he had come all the way from martinique on sutpenps bare promise and lived for two years on venison cooked over a camp firep in an unfloored tent made of the wagon hoodp before he so much as saw any color or shape of payp and until he passed through town on his way back to new orleans two years laterp he was not even to see jefferson againp he would not comep or sutpen would not bring himp to town even on the few occasions when sutpen would be seen therep and he did not have much chance to look at jefferson on that first day because the wagon did not stopp apparently it was only by sheer geographical hap that sutpen passed through town at allp pausing only long enough for someone pnot general compsonp to look beneath the wagon hood and into a black tunnel filled with still eyeballs and smelling like a wolfdenp but the legend of sutpenps wild negroes was not to begin at oncep because the wagon went on as though even the wood and iron which composed itp as well as the mules which drew itp had become imbued by sheer association with him with that quality of gaunt and tireless drivingp that conviction for haste and of fleeing timep later sutpen told quentinps grandfather that on that afternoon when the wagon passed through jefferson they had been without food since the previous night and that he was trying to reach sutpenps hundred and the river bottom to try to kill a deer before darkp so he and the architect and the negroes would not have to spend another night without foodp so the legend of the wild men came gradually back to townp brought by the men who would ride out to watch what was going onp who began to tell how sutpen would take stand beside a game trail with the pistols and send the negroes in to drive the swamp like a pack of houndsp it was they who told how during that first summer and fall the negroes did not even have por did not usep blankets to sleep inp even before the coonphunter akers claimed to have walked one of them out of the absolute mud like a sleeping alligator and screamed just in timep the negroes could speak no english yet and doubtless there were more than akers who did not know that the language in which they and sutpen communicated was a sort of french and not some dark and fatal tongue of their ownp there were many more than akersp though the others were responsible citizens and landowners and so did not have to lurk about the camp at nightp in factp as miss coldfield told quentinp they would make up parties to meet at the holston house and go out horsebackp often carrying lunchp sutpen had built a brick kiln and he had set up the saw and planer which he had brought in the wagon p a capstan with a long sapling walkingpbeamp with the wagon team and the negroes in shifts and himself too when necessaryp when the machinery slowedp hitched to it p as if the negroes actually were wild menp as general compson told his sonp quentinps fatherp while the negroes were working sutpen never raised his voice at themp that instead he led themp caught them at the psychological instant by examplep by some ascendancy of forbearance rather than by brute fearp without dismounting pusually sutpen did not even greet them with as much as a nodp apparently as unaware of their presence as if they had been idle shadesp they would sit in a curious quiet clump as though for mutual protection and watch his mansion risep carried plank by plank and brick by brick out of the swamp where the clay and timber waited p the bearded white man and the twenty black ones and all stark naked beneath the croaching and pervading mudp being menp these spectators did not realise that the garments which sutpen had worn when he first rode into jefferson were the only ones in which they had ever seen himp and few of the women in the county had seen him at all yetp otherwisep some of them would have anticipated miss coldfield in this toop in divining that he was saving his clothesp since decorum even if not elegance of appearance would be the only weapon por ratherp ladderp with which he could conduct the last assault upon what miss coldfield and perhaps others believed to be respectability p that respectability whichp according to general compsonp consisted in sutpenps secret mind of a great deal more than the mere acquisition of a chatelaine for his housep so he and the twenty negroes worked togetherp plastered over with mud against the mosquitoes andp as miss coldfield told quentinp distinguishable one from another by his beard and eyes alone and only the architect resembling a human creature because of the french clothes which he wore constantly with a sort of invincible fatality until the day after the house was completed save for the windowglass and the ironware which they could not make by hand and the architect departed p working in the sun and heat of summer and the mud and ice of winterp with quiet and unflagging furyp it took him two yearsp he and his crew of imported slaves which his adopted fellow citizens still looked on as being a good deal more deadly than any beast he could have started and slain in that countryp they worked from sunup to sundown while parties of horsemen rode up and sat their horses quietly and watchedp and the architect in his formal coat and his paris hat and his expression of grim and embittered amazement lurked about the environs of the scene with his air something between a casual and bitterly disinterested spectator and a condemned and conscientious ghost p amazementp general compson saidp not at the others and what they were doing so much as at himselfp at the inexplicable and incredible fact of his own presencep but he was a good architectp quentin knew the housep twelve miles from jeffersonp in its grove of cedar and oakp seventypfive years after it was finishedp and not only an architectp as general compson saidp but an artist since only an artist could have borne those two years in order to build a house which he doubtless not only expected but firmly intended never to see againp notp general compson saidp the hardship to sense and the outrage to sensibility of the two yearsp sojournp but sutpenp that only an artist could have borne sutpenps ruthlessness and hurry and still manage to curb the dream of grim and castlelike magnificence at which sutpen obviously aimedp since the place as sutpen planned it would have been almost as large as jefferson itself at the timep that the little grim harried foreigner had singlehanded given battle to and vanquished sutpenps fierce and overweening vanity or desire for magnificence or for vindication or whatever it was peven general compson did not know yetp and so created out of sutpenps very defeat the victory whichp in conqueringp sutpen himself would have failed to gainp so it was finished thenp down to the last plank and brick and wooden pin which they could make themselvesp unpainted and unfurnishedp without a pane of glass or a doorknob or hinge in itp twelve miles from town and almost that far from any neighborp it stood for three years more surrounded by its formal gardens and promenadesp its slave quarters and stables and smokehousesp wild turkey ranged within a mile of the house and deer came light and colored like smoke and left delicate prints in the formal beds where there would be no flowers for four years yetp now there began a periodp a phasep during which the town and the county watched him with more puzzlement yetp perhaps it was because the next step toward that secret end which general compson claimed to have known but which the town and the county comprehended but dimly or not at allp now required patience or passive time instead of that driving fury to which he had accustomed themp now it was the women who first suspected what he wantedp what the next step would bep none of the menp certainly not those who knew him well enough to call him by namep suspected that he wanted a wifep doubtless there were some of themp husbands and bachelors bothp who not only would have refused to entertain the idea but would even have protested against itp because for the next three years he led what must have been to them a perfect existencep he lived out therep eight miles from any neighborp in masculine solitude in what might be called the halfacre gunroom of a baronial splendorp he lived in the spartan shell of the largest edifice in the countyp not excepting the courthouse itselfp whose threshold no woman had so much as seenp without any feminised softness of window pane or door or mattressp where there was not only no woman to object if he should elect to have his dogs in to sleep on the pallet bed with himp he did not even need dogs to kill the game which left footprints within sight of the kitchen door but hunted it instead with human beings who belonged to him body and soul and of whom it was believed por saidp that they could creep up to a bedded buck and cut its throat before it could movep it was at this time that he began to invite the parties of men of which miss coldfield told quentinp out to sutpenps hundred to camp in blankets in the naked rooms of his embryonic formal opulencep they huntedp and at night played cards and drankp and on occasion he doubtless pitted his negroes against one another and perhaps even at this time participated now and then himself p that spectacle whichp according to miss coldfieldp his son was unable to bear the sight of while his daughter looked on unmovedp sutpen drank himself nowp though there were probably others beside quentinps grandfather who remarked that he drank very sparingly save when he himself had managed to supply some of the liquorp his guests would bring whiskey out with them but he drank of this with a sort of sparing calculation as though keeping mentallyp general compson saidp a sort of balance of spiritual solvency between the amount of whiskey he accepted and the amount of running meat which he supplied to the gunsp he lived like that for three yearsp he now had a plantationp inside of two years he had dragged house and gardens out of virgin swampp and plowed and planted his land with seed cotton which general compson loaned himp then he seemed to quitp he seemed to just sit down in the middle of what he had almost finishedp and to remain so for three years during which he did not even appear to intend or want anything morep perhaps it is not to be wondered at that the men in the county came to believe that the life he now led had been his aim all the timep it was general compsonp who seemed to have known him well enough to offer to lend him seed cotton for his startp who knew any betterp to whom sutpen ever told anything about his pastp it was general compson who knew first about the spanish coin being his last onep as it was compson pso the town learned laterp who offered to lend sutpen the money to finish and furnish his housep and was refusedp so doubtless general compson was the first man in the county to tell himself that sutpen did not need to borrow money with which to complete the housep supply what it yet lackedp because he intended to marry itp not the first personp the first manp sincep according to what miss coldfield told quentin seventypfive years laterp the women in the county had been telling one another and their husbands as well that sutpen did not intend to quit therep that he had already gone to too much troublep gone through too much privation and hardshipp to settle down and live exactly as he had lived while the house was being built save that now he had a roof to sleep under in place of an unfloored wagon hoodp probably the women had already cast about among the families of the men who might now be called his friendsp for that prospective bride whose dowry might complete the shape and substance of that respectability miss coldfield anyway believed to be his aimp so whenp at the expiration of this second phasep three years after the house was finished and the architect departedp and again on sunday morning and again without warningp the town saw him cross the squarep on foot now but in the same garments in which he had ridden into town five years ago and which no one had seen since phe or one of the negroes had ironed the coat with heated bricksp general compson told quentinps fatherp and enter the methodist churchp only some of the men were surprisedp the women merely said that he had exhausted the possibilities of the families of the men with whom he had hunted and gambled and that he had now come to town to find a wife exactly as he would have gone to the memphis market to buy livestock or slavesp but when they comprehended whom it was that he had apparently come to town and into church to invest with his choicep the assurance of the women became one with the menps surprisep and then even more than thatp amazementp because the town now believed that it knew himp for two years it had watched him as with that grim and unflagging fury he had erected that shell of a house and laid out his fieldsp then for three years he had remained completely staticp as if he were run by electricity and someone had come along and removedp dismantled the wiring or the dynamop while the women of the county gradually convinced it that he was merely waiting to find a wife with a dowry to finish it withp so that when he entered the methodist church that sunday morning in his ironed coatp there were men as well as women who believed that they had only to look around the congregation in order to anticipate the direction his feet would take himp until they became aware that he had apparently marked down miss coldfieldps father with the same cold and ruthless deliberation with which he had probably marked down the french architectp they watched in shocked amazement while he laid deliberate siege to the one man in the town with whom he could have had nothing in commonp least of allp money p a man who obviously could do nothing under the sun for him save give him credit at a little crossproads store or cast a vote in his favor if he should ever seek ordination as a methodist minister p a methodist stewardp a merchant not only of modest position and circumstances but who already had a wife and family of his ownp let alone a dependent mother and sisterp to support out of the proceeds of a business which he had brought to jefferson ten years ago in a single wagon p a man with a name for absolute and undeviating and even puritan uprightness in a country and time of lawless opportunityp who neither drank nor gambled nor even huntedp in their surprise they forgot that mr coldfield had a marriageable daughterp they did not consider the daughter at allp they did not think of love in connection with sutpenp they thought of ruthlessness rather than justice and of fear rather than respectp but not of pity or lovep besides being too lost in amazed speculation as to just how sutpen intended or could contrive to use mr coldfield to further whatever secret ends he still hadp they were never to knowp even miss rosa coldfield did notp because from that day there were no more hunting parties out at sutpenps hundredp and when they saw him now it would be in townp but not loafingp idlingp the men who had slept and matched glasses with him under his roof psome of them had even come to call him sutpen without the formal misterp watched him pass along the street before the holston house with a single formal gesture to his hat and go on and enter mr coldfieldps storep and that was allp pthen one day he quitted jefferson for the second timepp mr compson told quentinp pthe town should have been accustomed to that by nowp neverthelessp his position had subtly changedp as you will see by the townps reaction to this second returnp because when he came back this timep he was in a sense a public enemyp perhaps this was because of what he brought back with him this timep the material he brought back this timep as compared to the simple wagon load of wild niggers which he had brought back beforep but i dont think sop that isp i think it was a little more involved than the sheer value of his chandeliers and mahogany and rugsp i think that the affront was born of the townps realization that he was getting it involved with himselfp that whatever the felony which produced the mahogany and crystalp he was forcing the town to compound itp heretoforep until that sunday when he came to churchp if he had misused or injured anybodyp it was only old ikkemotubbep from whom he got his land p a matter between his conscience and uncle sam and godp but now his position had changedp because whenp about three months after he departedp four wagons left jefferson to go to the river and meet himp it was known that mr coldfield was the man who hired and dispatched themp they were big wagonsp drawn by oxenp and when they returned the town looked at them and knewp no matter what they might have containedp that mr coldfield could not have mortgaged everything that he owned for enough to fill themp doubtless this time there were more men than women even who pictured him during this absence with a handkerchief over his face and the two pistol barrels glinting beneath the candelabra of a steamboatps saloonp even if no worsep if not something performed in the lurking dark of a muddy landing and with a knife from behindp they saw him passp on the roan horse beside his four wagonsp it seems that even the ones who had eaten his food and shot his game and even called him psutpenp without the pmisterpp didnpt accost him nowp they just waited while reports and rumors came back to town of how he and his now somewhat tamed negroes had installed the windows and doors and the spits and pots in the kitchen and the crystal chandeliers in the parlors and the furniture and the curtains and the rugsp it was that same akers who had blundered onto the mudcouched negro five years ago who camep a little wildpeyed and considerably slackpmouthedp into the holston house bar one evening and saidp pboysp this time he stole the whole durn steamboatpp pso at last civic virtue came to a boilp one day and with the sheriff of the county among themp a party of eight or ten took the road out to sutpenps hundredp they did not go all the way because about six miles from town they met sutpen himselfp he was riding the roan horsep in the frock coat and the beaver hat which they knew and with his legs wrapped in a piece of tarpaulinp he had a portmanteau on his pommel and he was carrying a small woven basket on his armp he stopped the roan pit was april thenp and the road was still a quagmirep and sat there in his splashed tarpaulin and looked from one face to the nextp your grandfather said that his eyes looked like pieces of a broken plate and that his beard was strong as a currypcombp that was how he put itp strong as a currypcombp pgood morningp gentlemenpp he saidp pwere you looking for mepp pdoubtless something more than this transpired at the timep though none of the vigilance committee ever told it that i know ofp all i ever heard is how the townp the men on the gallery of the holston house saw sutpen and the committee ride onto the square togetherp sutpen a little in front and the others bunched behind him p sutpen with his legs and feet wrapped neatly in his tarpaulin and his shoulders squared inside the worn broadcloth coat and that worn brushed beaver cocked a littlep talking to them over his shoulder and those eyes hard and pale and reckless and probably quizzical and maybe contemptuous even thenp he pulled up at the door and the negro hostler ducked out and took the roanps head and sutpen got downp with his portmanteau and the basket and mounted the stepsp and i heard how he turned there and looked at them again where they huddled on their horsesp not knowing what to do exactlyp and it might have been a good thing that he had that beard and they could not see his mouthp then he turnedp and he looked at the other men sitting with their feet on the railing and watching him toop men who used to come out to his place and sleep on the floor and hunt with himp and he saluted them with that floridp swaggering gesture to the hat pyesp he was underbredp it showed like this alwaysp your grandfather saidp in all his formal contacts with peoplep he was like john lp sullivan having taught himself painfully and tediously to do the schottischep having drilled himself and drilled himself in secret until he now believed it no longer necessary to count the musicps beatp sayp he may have believed that your grandfather or judge benbow might have done it a little more effortlessly than hep but he would not have believed that anyone could have beat him in knowing when to do it and howp and besidesp it was in his facep that was where his power layp your grandfather saidp that anyone could look at him and sayp given the occasion and the needp this man can and will do anythingp and went on into the house and commanded a chamberp pso they sat on their horses and waited for himp i suppose they knew that he would have to come out sometimep i suppose they sat there and thought about those two pistolsp because there was still no warrant for himp you seep it was just public opinion in an acute state of indigestionp and now other horsemen rode into the square and became aware of the situationp so that there was quite a posse waiting when he walked out onto the galleryp he wore a new hat nowp and a new broadcloth coatp so they knew what the portmanteau had containedp they even knew now what the basket had contained because he did not have that with him now eitherp though doubtless at the time it merely puzzled them more than everp becausep you seep they had been too busy speculating on just how he was planning to use mr coldfield andp since his returnp too completely outraged by the belief that they now saw the results even if the means were still an enigmap to remember about miss ellen at allp pso he stopped again doubtless and looked from face to face againp doubtless memorising the new facesp without any hastep with still the beard to hide whatever his mouth might have shownp but he seems to have said nothing at all this timep he just descended the steps and walked on across the squarep the committee pyour grandfather said it had grown to almost fifty by nowp moving toop following him across the squarep they say he did not even look backp he just walked onp erectp with the new hat cocked and carrying in his hand now that which must have seemed to them the final gratuitous bafflement and even insultp with the committee riding along in the street beside him and not quite parallelp and others who did not happen to have horses at the moment joining in and following the committee in the roadp and ladies and children and women slaves coming to the doors and windows of the homes as they passed to watch as they went on in grim tableaup and sutpenp still without once looking backp entered mr coldfieldps gate and strode on up the brick walk to the doorp carrying his newspaper cornucopia of flowersp pthey waited for him againp the crowd was growing fast now p other men and a few boys and even some negroes from the adjacent housesp clotting behind the eight original members of the committee who sat watching mr coldfieldps door until he emergedp it was a good while and he no longer carried the flowersp and when he returned to the gatep he was engaged to be marriedp but they did not know thisp because as soon as he reached the gatep they arrested himp they took him back to townp with the ladies and children and house niggers watching from behind curtains and behind the shrubbery in the yards and the corners of the housesp the kitchens where doubtless food was already beginning to scorchp and so back to the square where the rest of the ablepbodied men left their offices and stores to followp so that when he reached the courthousep sutpen had a larger following than if he actually had been the runaway slavep they arraigned him before a justicep but by that time your grandfather and mr coldfield had got therep they signed his bond and late that afternoon he returned home with mr coldfieldp walking along the same street as of the forenoonp with doubtless the same faces watching him from behind the window curtainsp to the betrothal supper with no wine at table and no whiskey before or afterp i have heard how during none of his three passages that day through that street did his bearing alter p the same unhurried stride to which that new frock coat swungp the same angle to the new hat above the eyes and the beardp your grandfather said that some of the faience appearance which the flesh of his face had had when he came to town five years ago was gone now and that his face had an honest sunburnp and he was not fleshier eitherp your grandfather said that was not itp it was just that the flesh on his bones had become quieterp as though passive after some actual breasting of atmosphere like in runningp so that he actually filled his clothes nowp with that quality still swaggering but without braggadocio or belligerencep though according to your grandfather the quality had never been belligerencep only watchfulnessp and now that was gonep as though after the three years he could trust his eyes alone to do the watchingp without the flesh on his bones standing sentry alsop two months laterp he and miss ellen were marriedp pit was in june of 1838p almost five years to the day from that sunday morning when he rode into town on the roan horsep it pthe weddingp was in the same methodist church where he saw ellen for the first timep according to miss rosap the aunt had even forced or nagged pnot cajoledp that would not have done itp mr coldfield into allowing ellen to wear powder on her face for the occasionp the powder was to hide the marks of tearsp but before the wedding was over the powder was streaked againp caked and channelledp ellen seems to have entered the church that night out of weeping as though out of rainp gone through the ceremony and then walked back out of the church and into the weeping againp the tears againp the same tears evenp the same rainp she got into the carriage and departed in it pthe rainp for sutpenps hundredp pit was the wedding which caused the tearsp not marrying sutpenp whatever tears there were for thatp granted there were tearsp came laterp it was not intended to be a big weddingp that isp mr coldfield seems not to have intended it to bep of the two men pi dont speak of ellenp of coursep in factp you will notice that most divorces occur with women who were married by tobaccopchewing abbreviationremoved ps in country courthouses or by ministers waked after midnightp with their suspenders showing beneath their coattails and no collar on and a wife or spinster sister in curl papers for witnessp so is it too much to believe that these women come to long for divorce from a sense not of incompleteness but of actual frustration and betrayalp that regardless of the breathing evidence of children and all elsep they still have in their minds even yet the image of themselves walking to music and turning headsp in all the symbolical trappings and circumstances of ceremonial surrender of that which they no longer possessp and why notp since to them the actual and authentic surrender can only be pand have beenp a ceremony like the breaking of a banknote to buy a ticket for the trainp p of the two men it was sutpen who desired por hopedp i have this from something your grandfather let drop one day and which he doubtless had from sutpen himself in the same accidental fashionp since sutpen never even told ellen that he wanted itp which p the fact that at the last minute he refused to support her in her desire and insistence upon it p accounts partly for the tearsp the big weddingp the full church and all the ritualp mr coldfield apparently intended merely to employp usep the churchp apart from its spiritual significancep exactly as he might or would have used any other objectp concrete or abstractp to which he had given a certain amount of his timep he seems to have intended to use the church into which he had invested a certain amount of sacrifice and doubtless selfpdenial and certainly actual labor and money for the sake of what might be called a demand balance of spiritual solvencyp exactly as he would have used a cotton gin in which he considered himself to have incurred either interest or responsibilityp for the ginning of any cotton which he or any member of his familyp by blood or by marriagep had raised p thatp and no morep perhaps this was due to the same tedious and unremitting husbandry which had enabled him to support mother and sister and marry and raise a family on the proceeds of that store which ten years ago had fitted into a single wagonp or perhaps it was some innate sense of delicacy and fitness pwhich his sister and daughter did not seem to possessp by the wayp regarding the prospective sonpinplaw whom just two months ago he had been instrumental in getting out of jailp but not from any lack of courage regarding the sonpinplawps still anomalous position in the townp regardless of what their relations before that had been and of what their future relations might bep if mr coldfield had believed sutpen guilty at the time of any crimep he would not have raised a finger to take sutpen outp he might not have gone out of his way to keep sutpen in jailp but doubtless the best possible moral fumigation which sutpen could have received at the time in the eyes of his fellow citizens was the fact that mr coldfield signed his bond p something he would not have done to save his own good name even though the arrest had been a direct result of the business between himself and sutpen p that affair whichp when it reached a point where his conscience refused to sanction itp he had withdrawn from and let sutpen take all the profitp refusing even to allow sutpen to reimburse him for the loss whichp in withdrawingp he had sufferedp though he did permit his daughter to marry this man of whose actions his conscience did not approvep this was the second time he did something like thatp pwhen they were marriedp there were just ten people in the churchp including the wedding partyp of the hundred who had been invitedp though when they emerged from the church pit was at nightp sutpen had brought in a half dozen of his wild negroes to wait at the door with burning pine knotsp the rest of the hundred were there in the persons of boys and youths and men from the droversp tavern on the edge of town p stock traders and hostlers and such who had not been invitedp that was the other half of the reason for ellenps tearsp it was the aunt who persuaded or cajoled mr coldfield into the big weddingp sutpen had not expressed himselfp but he wanted itp in factp miss rosa was righter than she knewp he did wantp not the anonymous wife and the anonymous childrenp but the two namesp the stainless wife and the unimpeachable fatherpinplawp on the licensep the patentp yesp patentp with a gold seal and red ribbons too if that had been practicablep but not for himselfp she pmiss rosap would have called the gold seal and the ribbons vanityp but thenp so had vanity conceived that house andp in a strange place and with little else but his bare hands and further handicapped by the chance and probability of meddling interference arising out of the disapprobation of all communities of men toward any situation which they do not understandp built itp and pridep she admitted to you that he was bravep perhaps she will even allow him pridep the same pride which wanted such a housep which would accept nothing lessp and drove through to get it at whatever cost and then lived in itp alonep on a pallet on the floor for three years until he could furnish it as it should be furnished p not the least of which furniture was that wedding licensep she was quite rightp it was not just shelterp just anonymous wife and children that he wantedp just as he did not want just a weddingp but he never told ellenp nor anyonep in factp when the female crisis camep when ellen and the aunt tried to enlist him on their side to persuade mr coldfield to the big weddingp he refused to support themp he doubtless remembered even better than mr coldfield that two months ago he had been in jailp that public opinion which at some moment during the five preceding years had swallowed him even though he never had quite ever lain quiet on its stomachp had performed one of mankindps natural and violent and inexplicable volte faces and regurgitated himp and it did not help him any that at least two of the citizens who should have made two of the teeth in the outraged jaw served instead as props to hold the jaw open and impotent while he walked out of it unharmedp pellen and the aunt remembered this toop the aunt didp being a womanp she was doubtless one of that league of jefferson women who on the second day after the town saw him five years agop had agreed never to forgive him for not having any pastp and who had remained consistentp since the marriage was now a closed incidentp she probably looked upon it as the one chance to thrust him back into the gullet of public opinion which had tried at last to refuse himp not only to secure her nieceps future as his wife but to justify the action of her brother in getting him out of jail and her own position as having apparently sanctioned and permitted the wedding which in reality she could not have prevented p thisp as miss rosa told youp for the sake of that big house and the position and state which the women realised long before the men did that he not only aimed at but was going to attainp or maybe women are even less complex than that and to them any wedding is better than no wedding and a big wedding with a villain preferable to a small one with a saintp pso the aunt even used ellenps tearsp and sutpenp who probably knew about what was going to happenp becoming as the time drew near graver and graverp not concernedp just watchfulp like he must have been from the day when he turned his back upon all that he knew p the faces and the customs p and phe was just fourteen thenp he told your grandfatherp just the same age that henry was that night in the stable which miss rosa told you aboutp which henry could not quite stand up top set out into a world which even in theoryp the average geographical schooling of the normal boy of fourteenp he knew nothing aboutp and with a fixed goal in his mind which most men do not set up until the blood begins to slow at thirty or more and then only because the image represents peace and indolence or at least a crowning of vanityp not the vindication of a past affront in the person of a son whose seed is not yetp and would not be for years yetp plantedp that same alertness which he had to wear day and night without changing or laying asidep like the clothing which without doubt and for a time at least he had to sleep in as well as live inp and in a country and among a people whose very language he had to learn and where because of this he was to make that mistake which if he had acquiesced to it would not even have been an error and whichp since he refused to accept it or be stopped by itp became his doomp p that unsleeping care which must have known that it could permit itself but one mistakep that alertness for measuring and weighing event against eventualityp circumstance against human naturep his own fallible judgment and mortal clay against not only human but natural forcesp choosing and discardingp compromising with his dream and his ambition like you must with the horse which you take across countryp over timberp which you control only through your ability to keep the animal from realising that actually you cannotp that actually it is the strongerp phis was the curious position nowp he was the solitary onep not ellenp she not only had the aunt to support herp but the fact that women never plead nor claim loneliness until impenetrable and insurmountable circumstance forces them to give up all hope of attaining the particular bauble which at the moment they happen to wantp and not mr coldfieldp he had not only public opinion but his own disinclination for the big wedding to support it without incongruity or paradoxp as ellen had her aunt as well as her own desire for the big wedding to support it without incongruity or paradoxp while sutpen wanted the big wedding more than ellen didp or for a deeper reason than she didp yet his judgment forewarned him how the town would take it even more than mr coldfieldps didp so while ellen was using her tears not only to coerce her father but to persuade sutpen to put his weight into the balance on her sidep he had but one enemy p mr coldfieldp but when he refused herp when he remained neutralp he had threep counting the auntp then pthe tears wonp ellen and the aunt wrote out a hundred invitations p sutpen brought in one of the wild negroes who carried them from door to door by hand p and even sent out a dozen more personal ones for the dress rehearsalp when they reached the church for the rehearsal on the night before the wedding and found the church itself empty and a handful of men from the townps purlieus pincluding two of old ikkemotubbeps chickasawsp standing in the shadows outside the doorp the tears came down againp ellen went through the rehearsalp but afterward the aunt took her home in a state very near hysteriap though by the next day it had become just quiet intermittent weeping againp there was some talk even of putting the wedding offp i dont know who it came fromp perhaps from sutpenp but i know who vetoed itp it was as though the aunt were now bentp no longer on merely thrusting sutpen down the townps throatp but thrusting the wedding itselfp she spent all the next day going from house to housep the invitation list in her handp in a house dress and a shawl and one of the coldfield negroes pthey were both womenp following herp perhaps for protectionp perhaps just sucked along like a leaf in the wake of that grim virago fury of female affrontp yesp she came to our housep though your grandfather had never intended anything else but to attend the weddingp the aunt must have had no doubts about father since father had helped take sutpen out of jailp though she was probably past all ratiocination by thenp she came to our house toop father and your grandmother were just married then and mother was a stranger in jefferson and i dont know what she thought except that she would never talk about what happenedp about the mad woman whom she had never seen beforep who came bursting into the housep not to invite her to a wedding but to dare her not to comep and then rushed out againp mother could not even tell what wedding she meant at firstp and when father came home he found mother in hysterics toop and even twenty years later mother could not tell what actually happenedp there was nothing comic in it to herp father used to tease her about itp but even twenty years after that dayp when he would tease her i have seen her begin to raise her hand pperhaps with the thimble on one fingerp as though to protect herself and the same look come into her face that must have been there when ellenps aunt departedp pshe covered the town that morningp it did not take her long and it was completep by nightfall the circumstances of the situation had spread not only beyond the town but beneath itp penetrating the livery stable and the droversp tavern which was to supply the guests who did attend itp not only as notice but as a blanket threat and darep ellen of course was not aware of thisp anymore than the aunt herself wasp or would have believed what was going to happen even if she had been clairvoyantp could actually have seen the rehearsal of events before time produced themp not that the aunt would have considered herself insulated against being thus affrontedp she simply could not have believed that her intentions and actions of the day could have any result other than the one for which she had surrendered for the time not only all coldfield dignity but all female modesty as wellp sutpen i suppose could have told herp but doubtless he knew that the aunt would not have believed himp probably he did not even tryp he just did the only thing he could dop which was to send out to sutpenps hundred and bring in six or seven more of his negroesp men on whom he could dependp the only men on whom he could dependp and arm them with the lighted pine knots which they were holding at the door when the carriage came up and the wedding party got outp and this is where the tears stoppedp because now the street before the church was lined with carriages and buggiesp though only sutpen and possibly mr coldfield remarked that instead of being drawn up before the door and emptyp they were halted across the street and still occupiedp and that now the banquette before the church door was a sort of arena lighted by the smoking torches which the negroes held above their headsp the light of which wavered and gleamed upon the two lines of faces between which the party would have to pass to enter the churchp there were no catcalls yetp no jeeringp evidently neither ellen nor the aunt suspected that anything was wrongp pbecause for the time ellen even walked out of the weepingp the tearsp and so into the churchp it was empty yet save for your grandfather and grandmother and perhaps a half dozen more who might have come out of loyalty to the coldfields or perhaps to be close and so miss nothing of that which the townp as represented by the waiting carriagesp seemed to have anticipated as well as sutpen didp it was still empty even after the ceremony started and concludedp because ellen had something of pride toop or at least that vanity which at times can assume the office of pride and fortitudep besidesp nothing had happened yetp the crowd outside was quiet yetp perhaps out of respect for the churchp out of that aptitude and eagerness of the anglopsaxon for complete mystical acceptance of immolated sticks and stonesp she seems to have walked out of the church and so into it without any warning whateverp perhaps she was still moving beneath that pride which would not allow the people inside the church to see her weepp she just walked into itp probably hurrying toward the seclusion of the carriage where she could weepp perhaps her first intimation was the voice shoutingp plook outp dont hit her nowpp and then the object p dirtp filthp whatever it was p passing herp or perhaps the changing light itself as she turned and saw one of the negroesp his torch raised and in the act of springing toward the crowdp the facesp when sutpen spoke to him in that tongue which even now a good part of the county did not know was a civilised languagep that was what she sawp what the others saw from the halted carriages across the street p the bride shrinking into the shelter of his arm as he drew her behind him and he standing therep not moving even after another object pthey threw nothing which could actually injurep it was only clods of dirt and vegetable refusep struck the hat from his headp and a third struck him full in the chest p standing there motionlessp with an expression almost of smiling where his teeth showed through the beardp holding his wild negroes with that one word pthere were doubtless pistols in the crowdp certainly knivesp the negro would not have lived ten seconds if he had sprungp while about the wedding party the circle of faces with open mouths and torchpreflecting eyes seemed to advance and waver and shift and vanish in the smoky glare of the burning pinep he retreated to the carriagep shielding the two women with his bodyp ordering the negroes to follow with another wordp but they threw nothing elsep apparently it was that first spontaneous outburstp though they had come armed and prepared with the ones they did throwp in factp that seemed to have been the entire business which had come to a head when the vigilance committee followed him to mr coldfieldps gate that day two months beforep because the men who had composed the mobp the traders and drovers and teamstersp returnedp vanished back into the region from which they had emerged for this one occasion like ratsp scatteredp departed about the country p

lugubrious and vindictive anticipation while she waited for the infancy and childhood with which nature had confounded and betrayed her to overtake the precocity of convinced disapprobation regarding

spoke of bon as if he were three inanimate objects in one or perhaps one inanimate object for which she and her family would find three concordant usesp a garment which judith might wear as she would a riding habit or a ball gownp a piece of furniture which would complement and complete the furnishing of her house and positionp and a mentor and example to correct henryps provincial manners and

the living fairy talep it sounded like a fairy tale when ellen told it later to your grandmotherp only it was a fairy tale written for and acted by a fashionable ladiesp clubp but to miss rosa it must

are qualified to reciprocate whatever particularly signal honor marriage with anyone might confer upon thempp naturally there is no known rejoinder to thisp at leastp as far as ellen ever toldp miss rosa did not try to make onep she just saw ellen depart and then set about to make judith the second only gift in her powerp she possessed two nowp this one likewise bequeathed to her by the aunt who taught her both to keep house and how to fit clothes by climbing out a window one nightp though this second gift developed late pyou might sayp repercussedp due to the fact that when the aunt leftp miss rosa was not yet large enough to be able to use the discarded clothing even by cutting the garments downp she set about secretly making garments for judithps trousseaup she got the cloth from her fatherps storep she could not have got it anywhere elsep your grandmother told me that at that time miss rosa actually could not count moneyp changep that she knew the progression of the coins in theory but that apparently she had never had the actual cash to seep touchp experiment and prove withp that on certain days of the week she would go down town with a basket and shop at certain stores which mr coldfield had already designatedp with no coin nor sum of money changing lip or handp and that later in the day mr coldfield would trace her course by the debits scratched on paper or on walls and countersp and pay themp so she would have to get the material from himp and as he had brought his entire business to jefferson in one wagonp and this at a time when he had mother sister wife and children to support out of it as against now when he had but one child to support out of itp and weighed along with this that profound disinterest in material accumulation which had permitted conscience to cause him to withdraw from that old affair in which his sonpinplaw had involved him not only at the cost of his just profits but at the sacrifice of his original investmentp his stock which had begun as a collection of the crudest necessities and which apparently could not even feed himself and his daughter from its own shelvesp had not increasedp let alone diversifiedp yet this was where she had to go to get the material to make those intimate young girl garments which were to be for her own vicarious bridal p and you can imagine too what miss rosaps notion of such garments would bep let alone what her notion of them would look like when she had finished them unassistedp nobody knows how she managed to get the material from her fatherps storep he didnpt give it to herp he would have felt it incumbent on him to supply his granddaughter with clothes if she were indecently clad or if she were ragged or coldp but not to marry inp so i believe she stole itp she must havep she must have taken it almost from under her fatherps nose pit was a small store and he was his own clerk and from any point in it he could see any other pointp with that amoral boldnessp that affinity for brigandage of womenp but more likelyp or so i would like to thinkp by some subterfuge of such bald and desperate transparence concocted by innocence that its very simplicity fooled himp so she didnpt even see ellen anymorep apparently ellen had now served her purposep completed the bright pointless noon and afternoon of the butterflyps summer and vanishedp perhaps not out of jeffersonp but out of her sisterps life anywayp to be seen but the one time more dying in bed in a darkened room in the house on which fateful mischance had already laid its hand to the extent of scattering the black foundation on which it had been erected and removing its two male mainstaysp husband and son p the one into the risk and danger of battlep the other apparently into oblivionp henry had just vanishedp she heard of that too while she was spending her days pand nightsp she would have to wait until her father was asleepp sewing tediously and without skill on the garments which she was making for her nieceps trousseau and which she had to keep hidden not only from her father but from the two negressesp who might have told mr coldfield p whipping lace out of ravelled and hoarded string and thread and sewing it onto garments while news came of lincolnps election and of the fall of sumpter and she scarce listeningp hearing and losing the knell and doom of her native land between two tedious and clumsy stitches on a garment which she would never wear and never remove for a man whom she was not even to see alivep henry just vanishedp she heard just what the town heard p that on this next christmas henry and bon came home again to spend the holidaysp the handsome and wealthy new orleansian whose engagement to the daughter the mother had been filling the townps ears with for six months nowp they came again and now the town listened for the announcement of the actual dayp and then something happenedp nobody knew whatp whether something between henry and bon on one hand and judith on the otherp or between the three young people on one hand and the parents on the otherp but anywayp when christmas day camep henry and bon were gonep and ellen was not visible pshe seemed to have retired to the darkened room which she was not to quit until she died two years laterp and nobody could have told from either sutpenps or judithps faces or actions or behaviorp and so the tale came through the negroesp of how on the night before christmas there had been a quarrel betweenp not bon and henry or bon and sutpenp but between the son and the father and that henry had formally abjured his father and renounced his birthright and the roof under which he had been born and that he and bon had ridden away in the night and that the mother was prostrate p thoughp the town believedp not at the upset of the marriage but at the shock of reality entering her lifep this the merciful blow of the axe before the beastps throat is cutp though ellen of course did not know this eitherp thatps what miss rosa heardp nobody knows what she thoughtp the town believed that henryps action was just the fiery nature of youthp let alone a sutpenp and that time would cure itp doubtless sutpenps and judithps behavior toward one another and toward the town had something to do with thisp they would be seen together in the carriage in town now and then as though nothing had occurred between them at leastp which certainly would not have been the case if the quarrel had been between bon and the fatherp and probably not the case if the trouble had been between henry and his father because the town knew that between henry and judith there had been a relationship closer than the traditional loyalty of brother and sister evenp a curious relationshipp something of that fierce impersonal rivalry between two cadets in a crack regiment who eat from the same dish and sleep under the same blanket and chance the same destruction and who would risk death for one another not for the otherps sake but for the sake of the unbroken front of the regiment itselfp thatps all miss rosa knewp she could have known no more about it than the town knew because the ones who did know psutpen or judithp not ellenp who would have been told nothing in the first place and would have forgotp failed to assimilatep it if she had been p ellen the butterflyp from beneath whom without warning the very sunbuoyed air had been withdrawnp leaving her now with the plump hands folded on the coverlet in the darkened room and the eyes above them probably not even suffering but merely filled with baffled incomprehensionp would not have told her anymore than they would have told anyone in jefferson or anywhere elsep she probably went out therep probably once and then no morep and doubtless she did not askp not even judithp perhaps knowing she would not be told or perhaps because she was waitingp and she must have told mr coldfield that there was nothing wrong and evidently she believed that herself since she continued to sew on the garments for judithps weddingp she was still doing that when mississippi seceded and when the first confederate uniforms began to appear in

depart because her father forbade her to leave the house until it was gonep refusing to allow her to take part in or be present with the other women and girls in the ceremony of its departurep though not because his sonpinplaw happened to be in itp he had never been an irascible man and before war was actually declared and mississippi secededp his acts and speeches of protest had been not only calm but logical and quite sensiblep but after the die was cast he seemed to change overnightp just as his daughter ellen changed her nature a few years beforep as soon as troops began to appear in jefferson he closed his store and kept it closed all during the period that soldiers were being mobilised and drilledp not only then but laterp after the regiment was gonep whenever casual troops would bivouac for the night in passingp refusing to sell any goods for any price not only to the military butp so it was toldp to the families not only of soldiers but of men or women who had supported secession and war only in talkp opinionp not only did he refuse to permit his sister to come back home to live while her horseptrader husband was in the armyp he would not even allow miss rosa to look out the window at passing soldiersp he had closed his store permanently and was at home all day nowp he and miss rosa lived in the back of the housep with the front door locked and the front shutters closed and fastenedp and wherep so the neighbors saidp he spent the day behind one of the slightly opened blinds like a picquet on postp armed not with a musket but with the big family

auntp it was miss rosa who entered thatp along with ellenps deathp on the day when she entered mr coldfieldps own and charles bonps and even sutpenpsp had been duly entered in his neat clerkps handp until a detachment of troops would passp whereupon he would open the bible and declaim in a harsh loud voice even above the sound of the tramping feetp the passages of the old violent vindictive mysticism which he had already marked as the actual picquet would have ranged his row of cartridges along the window sillp then one morning he learned that his store had been broken into and lootedp doubtless by a company of strange troops bivouacked on the edge of town and doubtless abettedp if only vocallyp by his own fellow citizensp that night he mounted to the attic with his hammer and his handful of nails and nailed the door behind him and threw the hammer out the windowp he was not a cowardp he was a man of uncompromising moral strengthp coming into a new country with a small stock of goods and supporting five people out of it in comfort and security at leastp he did it by close tradingp to be surep he could not have done it save by close trading or dishonestyp and as your

idea of wastep of wearing out and eating up and shooting away material in any cause whateverp now miss rosaps life consisted of keeping it in herself and her fatherp up to the night of the looting of the storep they had lived out of itp she would go to the store after dark with a basket and fetch back enough food to last for a day or twop so the stockp not renewed for some time before thatp was considerably reduced even before the lootingp and soon shep who had never been taught to do anything practical because the aunt had raised her to believe that she was not only delicate but actually preciousp was cooking the food which as time passed became harder and harder to come by and poorer and poorer in qualityp and hauling it up to her father at night by means of a well pulley and rope attached to the attic windowp she did this for three yearsp feeding in secret and at night and with food which in quantity was scarcely sufficient for onep the man whom she hatedp and she may not have known before that she hated him and she may not have known it now evenp nevertheless the first of the odes to southern soldiers in that portfolio which when your grandfather saw it in 1885 contained a

the old nails were still in the door and neighbors helped her break it in with axes and they found himp who had seen his sole means of support looted by the defenders of his causep even if he had repudiated it and themp with three daysp uneaten food beside his pallet bed as if he had spent the three days in a mental balancing of his terrestrial accountsp found the result and proved it and then

had ever had was not in the meagre spartan hoard which he had accumulated before his path crossed that of his future sonpinplawp p not in the money but in its representation of a balance in whatever spiritual countingphouse he believed would some day pay his sight drafts on selfpdenial and fortitudep and doubtless what hurt him most in the whole business with sutpen was not the loss of the money but the fact that he had had to sacrifice the hoardingp the symbol of the fortitude and abnegationp to keep intact the spiritual solvency which he believed that he had already established and securedp it was as if he had had to pay the same note twice because of some trifling oversight of date or signaturep so miss rosa was both pauper and orphanp with no kin above dust but judith and the aunt who

deserted also to follow the yankee troops awayp the wild blood which he had brought into the country and tried to mixp blendp with the tame which was already therep with the same care and for the same

never told her mother eitherp perhaps ellen did not know before she died that henry and bon were now privates in the company which their classmates at the university had organisedp miss rosa did not

for fortypthree yearsp as if she had been instinctively right even as a child in hating her father and so these fortypthree years of impotent and unbearable outrage were the revenge of some

hating of her father and aunt and her sisterps husband in peace and comfort and waiting for the day when they would prove not only to themselves but to everybody else that she had been rightp so one night the aunt slid down the rainpipe with a horse trader and she was right about the aunt so that fixed thatp then her father nailed himself up in the attic to keep from being drafted into the rebel army and starved to death so that fixed that except for the unavoidable possibility that when the moment came for him to admit to himself that she had been right he may not have been able to speak or may not have had anyone to tell it top so she was right about the father too since if he hadnpt made general lee and jeff davis mad he wouldnpt have had to nail himself up and die and if he hadnpt died he wouldnpt have left her an orphan and a pauper and so situatedp left susceptible to a situation where she could receive this mortal affrontp and right about the brotherpinplaw because if he

sample and if it was a boy they would marryp would not have had to be blown back to town on the initial blast of that horror and outrage to eat of gall and wormwood stolen through paling fences at dawnp so this was not fixed at all and forever because she couldnpt even tell it because of who her successor wasp not because he found a successor by just turning around and no dayps loss of time

and one day the architect couldnpt stand it anymore or he was afraid he would starve or that the wild niggers pand maybe colonel sutpen toop would run out of grub and eat him or maybe he got homesick

p p and so he wentp he seemed to vanish in broad daylightp right out from the middle of twentypone peoplep or maybe it was just sutpenps back that was turnedp and that the niggers saw him go and didnpt think it needed mentioningp that being wild men they probably didnpt know what sutpen himself was up to and him naked in the mud with them all dayp so i reckon they never did know what the architect was there forp supposed to do or had done or could do or wasp so maybe they thought sutpen had sent himp told him to go away and drown himselfp go away and diep or maybe just go awayp so he didp jumped up in broad daylightp in his embroidered vest and fauntleroy tie and a hat like a baptist congressman and probably carrying the hat in his handp and ran into the swamp and the niggers watched him out of sight and then went back to work and sutpen didnpt see itp didnpt even miss him until nightp suppertime probablyp and the niggers told him and he declared a holiday tomorrow because he would have to get out and borrow some dogsp not that he would have needed dogsp with his niggers to trailp but maybe he thought that the guestsp the othersp would not be used to trailing with niggers and would expect dogsp and grandfather phe was young then toop brought some champagne and some of the others brought whiskey and they began to gather out there a little after sundownp at his house that didnpt even have walls yetp that wasnpt anything yet but some lines of bricks sunk into the ground but that was all right because they didnpt go to bed anyhowp grandfather saidp they just sat around the fire with the champagne and the whiskey and a quarter of the last venison he had killedp and about midnight the man with the dogs camep then it was daylight and the dogs had a little trouble at first because some of the wild niggers had run out about a mile of the trail just for funp but they got the trail straightened out at lastp the dogs and the niggers in the bottom and most of the men riding along the edge of it where the going was goodp but grandfather and colonel sutpen went with the dogs and the niggers because sutpen was afraid the niggers might catch the architect before he could reach themp he and grandfather had to walk a good dealp sending one of the niggers to lead the horses on around the bad places until they could ride againp grandfather said it was fine weather and the trail lay pretty good but he said it would have been fine if the architect had just waited until october or novemberp and so he told grandfather something about itp phis trouble was innocencep all of a sudden he discoveredp not what he wanted to do but what he just had to dop had to do it whether he wanted to or notp because if he did not do it he knew that he could never live with himself for the rest of his lifep never live with what all the men and women that had died to make him had left inside of him for him to pass onp with all the dead ones waiting and watching to see if he was going to do it rightp fix things right so that he would be able to look in the face not only the old dead ones but all the living ones that would come after him when he would be one of the deadp and that at the very moment when he discovered what it wasp he found out that this was the last thing in the world he was equipped to do because he not only had not known that he would have to do thisp he did not even know that it existed to be wantedp to need to be donep until he was almost fourteen years oldp because he was born in west virginiap in the mountains where p p ppnot in west virginiapp shreve saidp p p whatpp quentin saidp pnot in west virginiapp shreve saidp pbecause if he was twentypfive years old in mississippi in 1833p he was born in 1808p and there wasnpt any west virginia in 1808 because p p pall rightpp quentin saidp p p west virginia wasnpt admitted p p pall right all rightpp quentin saidp p p into the united states until p p pall right all right all rightpp quentin saidpp p p where what few other people he knew lived in log cabins boiling with children like the one he was born in p men and grown boys who hunted or lay before the fire on the floor while the women and older girls stepped back and forth across them to reach the fire to cookp where the only colored people were indians and you only looked down at them over your rifle sightsp where he had never even heard ofp never imaginedp a placep a land divided neatly up and actually owned by men who did nothing but ride over it on fine horses or sit in fine clothes on the galleries of big houses while other people worked for themp he did not even imagine then that there was any such way to live or to want to livep or that there existed all the objects to be wanted which there werep or that the ones who owned the objects not only could look down on the ones that didnptp but could be supported in the downplooking not only by the others who owned objects too but by the very ones that were looked down on that didnpt own objects and knew they never wouldp because where he lived the land belonged to anybody and everybody and so the man who would go to the trouble and work to fence off a piece of it and say pthis is minep was crazyp and as for objectsp nobody had any more of them than you did because everybody had just what he was strong enough or energetic enough to take and keepp and only that crazy man would go to the trouble to take or even want more than he could eat or swap for powder and whiskeyp so he didnpt even know there was a country all divided and fixed and neat with a people living on it all divided and fixed and neat because of what color their skins happened to be and what they happened to ownp and where a certain few men not only had the power of life and death and barter and sale over othersp they had living human men to perform the endless repetitive personal offices such as pouring the very whiskey from the jug and putting the glass into his hand or pulling off his boots for him to go to bed that all men have had to do for themselves since time began and would have to do until they died and which no man ever has or ever will like to do but which no man that he knew had ever anymore thought of evading than he had thought of evading the effort of chewing and swallowing and breathingp when he was a child he didnpt listen to the vague and cloudy tales of tidewater splendor that penetrated even his mountains because then he could not understand what the people meantp and when he became a boy he didnpt listen to them because there was nothing in sight to compare and gauge the tales by and so give the words life and meaningp and no chance that he ever would pcertainly no belief or thought that someday he mightpp and because he was too busy doing the things that boys dop and when he got to be a youth and curiosity itself exhumed the tales which he did not know he had heard and speculated about themp he was interested and would have liked to see the places oncep but without envy or regretp because he just thought that some people were spawned in one place and some in anotherp some spawned rich pluckyp he may have called itp or maybe he called luckyp richp and some notp and that pso he told grandfatherp the men themselves had little to do with the choosing and less of the regret because phe told grandfather this toop it had never once occurred to him that any man should take any such blind accident as that as authority or warrant to look down at othersp any othersp so he had hardly heard of such a world until he fell into itp pthatps how it wasp they fell into itp the whole familyp returned to the coast from which the first sutpen had come pwhen the ship from the old bailey reached jamestown probablypp tumbled head over heels back to tidewater by sheer altitudep elevation and gravityp as if whatever slight hold the family had had phe said something to grandfather about his mother dying about that time and how his pap said she was a fine wearying woman and that he would miss herp and something about how it was the wife that had got his father even that far westp on the mountain had broken and now the whole passel of them from the father through the grown daughters down to one that couldnpt even walk yetp sliding back down out of the mountains and skating in a kind of accelerating and sloven and inert coherence like a useless collection of flotsam on a flooded river moving by some perverse automotivation such as inanimate objects sometimes showp backward against the very current of the streamp across the virginia plateau and into the slack lowlands about the mouth of the james riverp he didnpt know why they movedp or didnpt remember the reason if he ever knew it p whether it was optimismp hope in his fatherps breast or nostalgiap since he didnpt know just where his father had come fromp whether the country to which they returned was it or notp or even if his father knewp rememberedp wanted to remember and find it againp p whether somebodyp some travelerp had told him of some easy place or timep some escape from the hardship of getting food and keeping warm in the mountain wayp or if perhaps somebody his father knew once or who knew his father once and remembered himp happened to think about himp or someone kin to him who had tried to forget him and couldnpt quite do itp had sent for him and he obeyingp going not for the promised job but for the easep having faith perhaps in the blood kinship to evade the labor if it was kinshipp in his own inertia and in whatever gods had watched over him this far if it were notp but he p p ppthe demonpp shreve saidp p p didnpt knowp or rememberp whether he had ever heardp been toldp the reason or notp all he remembered was that one morning the father rose and told the older girls to pack what food they hadp and somebody wrapped up the baby and somebody else threw water on the fire and they walked down the mountain to where roads existedp they had a lopsided twopwheeled cart and two spavined oxen nowp he told grandfather he did not remember just where nor when nor how his father had got itp and he phe was ten thenp the two older boys had left home some time before and had not been heard of sincep driving the oxen since almost as soon as they got the cart his father began the practice of accomplishing that part of the translation devoted to motion flat on his back in the cartp oblivious among the quilts and lanterns and well buckets and bundles of clothing and childrenp snoring with alcoholp that was how he told itp he didnpt remember if it was weeks or months or a year they traveled pexcept that one of the older girls who had left the cabin unmarried was still unmarried when they finally stoppedp though she had become a mother before they lost the last blue mountain rangepp whether it was that winter and then spring and then summer overtook and passed them on the road or whether they overtook and passed in slow succession the seasons as they descended or whether it was the descent itself that did it and they not progressing parallel in time but descending perpendicularly through temperature and climate p a pyou couldnpt call it a period because as he remembered it or as he told grandfather he didp it didnpt have either a definite beginning or a definite endingp maybe attenuation is betterp p an attenuation from a kind of furious inertness and patient immobility while they sat in the cart outside the doors of doggeries and taverns and waited for the father to drink himself insensiblep to a sort of dreamy and destinationless locomotion after they had got the old man out of whatever shed or outhouse or barn or ditch and loaded him into the cart again and during which they did not seem to progress at all but just to hang suspended while the earth itself alteredp flattened and broadened out of the mountain cove where they had all been bornp mountingp rising about them like a tide in which the strange harsh rough faces about the doggery doors into which the old man was just entering or was just being carried or thrown out pand this one time by a huge bull of a niggerp the first black manp slavep they had ever seenp who emerged with the old man over his shoulder like a sack of meal and his p the niggerps p mouth loud with laughing and full of teeth like tombstonesp swam up and vanished and were replacedp the earthp the worldp rising about them and flowing past as if the cart moved on a treadmill pand it now spring and now summer and they still moving on toward a place they had never seen and had no conception ofp let alone wanted to go top and from a placep a little lost spot on the side of a hill back to which probably not one of them p excepting possibly the usually insensible father who made one stage of the journey accompanied by the raspberrypcolored elephants and snakes which he seems to have been hunting for p could have led the wayp bringing into and then removing from their sober static country astonishment the strange faces and placesp both faces and places p doggeries and taverns now become hamletsp hamlets now become villagesp villages now towns and the country flattened out now with good roads and fields and niggers working in the fields while white men sat fine horses and watched themp and more fine horses and men in fine clothesp with a different look in the face from mountain men about the taverns where the old man was not even allowed to come in by the front door and from which his mountain drinking manners got him ejected before he would have time to get drunk good pso that now they began to make really pretty good timep and no laughter and jeers to the ejecting nowp even if the laughter and jeers had been harsh and without much gentleness in themp pthatps the way he got itp he had learned the difference not only between white men and black onesp but he was learning that there was a difference between white men and white men not to be measured by lifting anvils or gouging eyes or how much whiskey you could drink then get up and walk out of the roomp that isp he had begun to discern that without being aware of it yetp he still thought that that was just a matter of where you were spawned and howp lucky or not luckyp and that the lucky ones would be even slower and lother than the unlucky to take any advantage of it or credit for itp feel that it gave them anything more than the luckp that they would feel if anything more tender toward

p not the being still at last and in a fashion settledp because they had done that before on the roadp he remembered how one time the gradual difference in comfort between the presence and absence of shoes and warm clothing occurred in one placep a cowshed where the sisterps baby was born andp as he told grandfatherp for all he could rememberp locate in elapsed timep conceived toop because they were stopped now at lastp he didnpt know where they werep for a timep during the first days or weeks or monthsp the woodsmanps instinct which he had acquired from the environment where he grew up or

such which they left in the cabin when they departed the last time for good p and which he had sharpened by boyps practice at small game and suchp kept him oriented so that he could have pso he saidp found his way back to the mountain cabin in timep but that was past nowp the moment when he last could have said exactly where he had been born now weeks and months pmaybe a yearp the yearp since that was when he became confused about his age and was never able to straighten it out againp so that he told grandfather that he did not know within a year on either side just how old he wasp behind himp

this was where he realised that he had irrevocably lost count of his agep lying there all afternoon while the sisters would come from time to time to the door of the cabin two miles away and scream at him for wood or waterp watching that man who not only had shoes in the summertime toop but didnpt even have to wear themp pbut he still didnpt envy the man he was watchingp he coveted the shoesp and probably he would have liked for his father to have a broadcloth monkey to hand him the jug and to carry the wood and water into the cabin for his sisters to wash and cook with and keep the house warm so that he himself would not have to do itp maybe he even realisedp understood the pleasure it would have given his sisters for their neighbors pother whites like themp who lived in other cabins not quite as well built and not at all as well kept and preserved as the ones the nigger slaves lived in but still nimbused with freedomps bright aurap which the slave quarters were not for all their sound roofs and white washp to see them being waited onp because he had not only not lost the innocence yetp he had not yet discovered that he possessed itp he no more envied the man than he would have envied a mountain man who happened to own a fine riflep he would have coveted the riflep but he would himself have supported and confirmed the ownerps pride and pleasure in its ownership because he could not have conceived of the owner taking such crass advantage of the luck which gave the rifle to him rather than to another as to say to other menp because i own this riflep my arms and legs and blood and bones are superior to yours except as the victorious outcome of a fight with riflesp and how in the world could a man fight another man with dressedpup niggers and the fact that he could lie in a hammock all afternoon with his shoes offp and what in the world would he be fighting for if he didp he didnpt even know he was innocent that day when his father sent him to the big house with the messagep he didnpt remember por did not sayp what the message wasp apparently he still didnpt know exactly just what his father didp what work por maybe supposed to dop the old man had in relation to the plantation p a boy either thirteen or fourteenp he didnpt know whichp in garments his father had got from the plantation commissary and had worn out and which one of the sisters had patched and cut down to fit him and he no more conscious of his appearance in them or of the possibility that anyone else would be than he was of his skinp following the road and turning into the gate and following the drive up past where still more niggers with nothing to do all day but plant flowers and trim grass were workingp and so to the housep the porticop the front doorp thinking how at last he was going to see the inside of itp see what else a man was bound to own who could have a special nigger to hand him his liquor and pull off his shoes that he didnpt even need to wearp never for one moment thinking but what the man would be as pleased to show him the balance of his things as the mountain man would have been to show the powder horn and bullet mold that went with the riflep because he was still innocentp he knew it without being aware that he didp he told grandfather howp before the monkey nigger who came to the door had finished saying what he didp he seemed to kind of dissolve and a part of him turn and rush back through the two years they had lived there like when you pass through a room fast and look at all the objects in it and you turn and go back through the room again and look at all the objects from the other side and you find out you had never seen them beforep rushing back through those two years and seeing a dozen things that had happened and he hadnpt even seen them beforep a certain flat level silent way his older sisters and the other white women of their kind had of looking at niggersp not with fear or dread but with a kind of speculative antagonism not because of any known fact or reason but inherited by both white and blackp the sensep effluvium of it passing between the white women in the doors of the sagging cabins and the niggers in the road and which was not quite explainable by the fact that the niggers had better clothesp and which the niggers did not return as antagonism or in any sense of dare or taunt but through the very fact that they were apparently oblivious of itp too oblivious of it pyou knew that you could hit themp he told grandfatherp and they would not hit back or even resistp but you did not want top because they pthe niggersp were not itp not what you wanted to hitp that when you hit them you would just be hitting a childps toy balloon with a face painted on itp a face slick and smooth and distended and about to burst into laughing and so you did not dare strike it because it would merely burst and you would rather let it walk on out of your sight than to have stood there in the loud laughingp p of talk at night before the fire when they had company or had themselves gone visiting after supper to another cabinp the voices of the women sober enoughp even calmp yet filled with a quality dark and sullen and only some manp usually his father in drinkp to break out into harsh recapitulation of his own worthp the respect which his own physical prowess commanded from his fellowsp and the boy of either thirteen or fourteen or maybe twelve knowing that the men and the women were talking about the same thing though it had never once been mentioned by namep like when people talk about privation without mentioning the siegep about sickness without ever naming the epidemicp p of one afternoon when he and his sister were walking along the road and he heard the carriage coming up behind them and stepped off the road and then realised that his sister was not going to give way to itp that she still walked in the middle of the road with a sort of sullen implacability in the very angle of her head and he shouted at herp and then it was all dust and rearing horses and glinting harness buckles and wheel spokesp he saw two parasols in the carriage and the nigger coachman in a plug hat shoutingp phoo darp galp git outen de way darpp and then it was overp gonep the carriage and the dustp the two faces beneath the parasols glaring down at his sisterp then he was throwing vain clods of dirt after the dust as it spun onp knowing nowp while the monkeypdressed nigger butler kept the door barred with his body while he spokep that it had not been the nigger coachman that he threw at at allp that it was the actual dust raised by the proud delicate wheelsp and just that vainp p of one night late when his father came homep blundered into the cabinp he could smell the whiskey even while still dulled with broken sleepp hearing that same fierce exultationp vindicationp in his fatherps voicep pwe whupped one of pettiboneps niggers tonightp and he roused at thatp waked at thatp asking which one of pettiboneps niggers and his father said he did not knowp had never seen the nigger beforep and he asked what the nigger had done and his father saidp phell firep that goddamn son of a bitch pettiboneps niggerpp p howp without knowing it then since he had not yet discovered innocencep he must have meant the question the same way his father meant the answerp no actual niggerp living creaturep living flesh to feel pain and writhe and cry outp he could even seem to see themp the torchpdisturbed darkness among treesp the fierce hysterical faces of the white menp the balloon face of the niggerp maybe the niggerps hands would be tied or held but that would be all right because they were not the hands with which the balloon face would struggle and writhe for freedomp not the balloon facep it was just poised among themp levitative and slick with paperpthin distensionp then someone would strike the balloon one single desperate and despairing blow and then he would seem to see them fleeingp runningp with all about themp overtaking them and passing and going on and then returning to overwhelm them againp the roaring waves of mellow laughter meaningless and terrifying and loudp and now he stood there before that white door with the monkey nigger barring it and looking down at him in his patched madepover jeans clothes and no shoes and i dont reckon he had even ever experimented with a comb because that would be one of the things that his sisters would keep hidden good p who had never thought about his own hair or clothes or anybody elseps hair or clothes until he saw that monkey niggerp who through no doing of his own happened to have had the felicity of being housebred in richmond maybep looking p p ppor maybe even in charlestonpp shreve breathedpp p p at them and he never even remembered what the nigger saidp how it was the nigger told himp even before he had had time to say what he came forp never to come to that front door again but to go around to the backp phe didnpt even remember leavingp all of a sudden he found himself running and already some distance from the housep and not toward homep he was not cryingp he saidp he wasnpt even madp he just had to thinkp so he was going to where he could be quiet and thinkp and he knew where that place wasp he went into the woodsp he says he did not tell himself where to gop that his bodyp his feetp just went there p a place where a game trail entered a cane brake and an oak tree had fallen across it and made a kind of cave where he kept an iron griddle that he would cook small game on sometimesp he said he crawled back into the cave and sat with his back against the uptorn rootsp and thoughtp because he couldnpt get it straight yetp he couldnpt even realise yet that his troublep his impedimentp was innocence because he would not be able to realise that until he got it straightp so he was seeking among what little he had to call experience for something to measure it byp and he couldnpt find anythingp he had been told to go around to the back door even before he could state his errandp who had sprung from a people whose houses didnpt have back doors but only windows and anyone entering or leaving by a window would be either hiding or escapingp neither of which he was doingp in factp he had actually come on businessp in the good faith of business which he had believed that all men acceptedp of course he had not expected to be invited in to eat a meal since timep the distance from one cooking pot to the nextp did not need to be measured in hours or daysp perhaps he had not expected to be asked into the house at allp but he did expect to be listened to because he had comep been sentp on some business whichp even though he didnpt remember what it was and maybe at the time phe saidp he might not even have comprehendedp was certainly connected somehow with the plantation that supported and endured that smooth white house and that smooth white brasspdecorated door and the very broadcloth and linen and silk stockings the monkey nigger stood in to tell him to go around to the back before he could even state the businessp it was like he might have been sent with a lump of lead or even a few molded bullets so that the man who owned the fine rifle could shoot itp and the man came to the door and told him to leave the bullets on a stump at the edge of the woodsp not even letting him come close enough to look at the riflep pbecause he was not madp he insisted on that to grandfatherp he was just thinkingp because he knew that something would have to be done about itp he would have to do something about it in order to live with himself for the rest of his life and he could not decide what it was because of that innocence which he had just discovered he hadp which pthe innocencep not the manp the traditionp he would have to compete withp he had nothing to compare and gauge it by but the rifle analogyp and it would not make sense by thatp he was quite calm about itp he saidp sitting there with his arms around his knees in his little den beside the game trail where more than once when the wind was right he had seen deer pass within ten feet of himp arguing with himself quietly and calmly while both debaters agreed that if there were only someone elsep some older and smarter person to askp but there was notp there was only himselfp the two of them inside that one body which was maybe thirteen or maybe fourteen or maybe was already fifteen but would never know it for certain forever morep arguing quiet and calmp but i can shoot himp pnot the monkey niggerp it was not the nigger anymore than it had been the nigger that his father had helped to whip that nightp the nigger was just another balloon face slick and distended with that mellow loud and terrible laughing so that he did not dare to burst itp looking down at him from within the half closed door during that instant in whichp before he knew itp something in him had escaped and p he unable to close the eyes of it p was looking out from within the balloon face just as the man who did not even have to wear the shoes he ownedp whom the laughter which the balloon held barricaded and protected from such as hep looked out from whatever invisible place he pthe manp happened to be at the momentp at the boy outside the barred door in his patched garments and splayed bare feetp looking through and beyond the boyp he himself seeing his own father and sisters and brothers as the ownerp the rich man pnot the niggerp must have been seeing them all the time p as cattlep creatures heavy and without gracep brutely evacuated into a world without hope or purpose for themp who would in turn spawn with brutish and vicious prolixityp populatep double treble and compoundp fill space and earth with a race whose future would be a succession of cutpdown and patched and madepover garments bought on exorbitant credit because they were white peoplep from stores where niggers were given the garments freep with for sole heritage that expression on a balloon face bursting with laughter which had looked out at some unremembered and nameless progenitor who had knocked at a door when he was a little boy and had been told by a nigger to go around to the backppp but i can shoot himp and the otherp nop that wouldnpt do no goodp and the firstp what shall we do thenp and the otherp i dont knowp and the firstp but i can shoot himp i could slip right up there through them bushes and lay there until he come out to lay in the hammock and shoot himp and the otherp nop that wouldnpt do no goodp and the firstp then what shall we dop and the otherp i dont knowp pnow he was hungryp it was before dinner when he went to the big housep and now there was no sun at all where he crouched though he could still see sun in the tops of the trees around himp but his stomach had already told him it was late and that it would be later still when he reached homep and then he said he began to think homep home and that he thought at first that he was trying to laugh and that he kept on telling himself it was laughing even after he knew betterp homep as he came out of the woods and approached itp still hidden yetp and looked at it p the rough partly rotten log wallsp the sagging roof whose missing shingles they did not replace but just set pans and buckets under the leaksp the leanto room which they used for kitchen and which was all right because in good weather it didnpt even matter that it had no chimney since they did not attempt to use it at all when it rainedp and his sister pumping rhythmic up and down above a washtub in the yardp her back toward himp shapeless in a calico dress and a pair of the old manps shoes unlaced and flapping about her bare ankles and broad in the beam as a cowp the very labor she was doing brutish and stupidly out of all proportion to its rewardp the very primary essence of laborp toilp reduced to its crude absolute which only a beast could and would endurep and now phe saidp the thought striking him for the first time as to what he would tell his father when the old man asked him if he had delivered the messagep whether he would lie or notp since if he did lie he would be found out maybe at oncep since probably the man had already sent a nigger down to see why whatever it was his father had failed to do and had sent the excuse for was not done p granted that that was what his errand to the house had beenp which pgranted his old manp it probably wasp but it didnpt happen at once because his father was not at home yetp so it was only the sisterp as if she had been waiting not for the wood but just for him to returnp for the opportunity to use her vocal cordsp nagging at him to fetch the wood and he not refusingp not objectingp just not hearing herp paying any attention to her because he was still thinkingp then the old man came and the sister told on him and the old man made him fetch the woodp and still nothing said about the errand while they ate supper nor when he went and lay down on the pallet where he slept and where he went to bed by just lying downp only not to sleep nowp just lying there with his hands under his head and still nothing said about it and he still not knowing if he was going to lie or notp because he said how the terrible part of it had not occurred to him yetp he just lay there while the two of them argued inside of himp speaking in orderly turnp both calmp even leaning backward to be calm and reasonable and unrancorousp but i can kill himp p nop that wouldnpt do no good p then what shall we do about itp p i dont knowp and he just listeningp not especially interested he saidp hearing the two of them without listeningp because what he was thinking about now he hadnpt asked forp it was just therep natural in a boyp a childp and he not paying any attention to it either because it was what a boy would have thoughtp and he knew that to do what he had to do in order to live with himself he would have to think it out straight as a man wouldp thinking the nigger never give me a chance to tell him what it was and so he pnot the nigger now eitherp wont know it and whatever it is wont get done and he wont know it aint done until too late so he will get paid back that much for what he set that nigger to do and if it only was to tell him that the stablep the housep was on fire and the nigger wouldnpt even let me tell himp warn him and then he said that all of a sudden it was not thinkingp it was something shouting it almost loud enough for his sisters on the other pallet and his father in the bed with the two youngest and filling the room with alcohol snoringp to hear toop he never even give me a chance to say itp not even to tell itp say itp it too fastp too mixed up to be thinkingp it all kind of shouting at him at oncep boiling out and over him like the nigger laughingp he never gave me a chance to say it and pap never asked me if i told him or not and so he cant even know that pap sent him any message and so whether he got it or not cant even matterp not even to papp i went up to that door for that nigger to tell me never to come to that front door again and i not only wasnpt doing any good to him by telling it or any harm to him by not telling itp there aint any good or harm either in the living world that i can do to himp it was like thatp he saidp like an explosion p a bright glare that vanished and left nothingp no ashes nor refusep just a limitless flat plain with the severe shape of his intact innocence rising from it like a monumentp that innocence instructing him as calm as the others had ever spokenp using his own rifle analogy to do it withp and when it said them in place of he or himp it meant more than all the human puny mortals under the sun that might lie in hammocks all afternoon with their shoes offp pif you were fixing to combat them that had the fine riflesp the first thing you would do would be to get yourself the nearest thing to a fine rifle you could borrow or steal or makep wouldnpt itpp and he said yesp pbut this aint a question of riflesp so to combat them you have got to have what they have that made them do what he didp you got to have land and niggers and a fine house to combat them withp you seepp and he said yes againp he left that nightp he waked before day and departed just like he went to bedp by rising from the pallet and tiptoeing out of the housep he never saw any of his family againp phe went to the west indiespp quentin had not movedp not even to raise his head from its attitude of brooding bemusement upon the open letter which lay on the open textbookp his hands lying on the table before him on either side of the book and the letterp one half of which slanted upward from the transverse crease without supportp as if it had learned half the secret of levitationp pthat was how he said itp he and grandfather were sitting on a log now because the dogs had faultedp that isp they had treed p a tree from which he pthe architectp could not have escaped yet which he had undoubtedly mounted because they found the sapling pole with his suspenders still knotted about one end of it that he had used to climb the tree though at first they could not understand why the suspenders and it was three hours before they comprehended that the architect had used architecturep physicsp to elude them as a man always falls back upon what he knows best in a crisis p the murderer upon murderp the thief thievingp the liar lyingp he pthe architectp knew about the wild negroes even if he couldnpt have known that sutpen would get dogsp he had chosen that tree and hauled that pole up after him and calculated stress and distance and trajectory and had crossed a gap to the next nearest tree that a flying squirrel could not have crossed and traveled from there on from tree to tree for almost half a mile before he put foot on the ground againp it was three hours before one of the wild niggers pthe dogs wouldnpt leave the treep they said he was in itp found where he had come downp so he and grandfather sat on the log and talkedp and one of the wild niggers went back to camp for grub and the rest of the whiskey and they blew the other men in with horns and they atep and he told grandfather some more of it while they waitedp phe went to the west indiesp thatps how he said itp not how he managed to find where the west indies were nor where ships departed from to go therep nor how he got to where the ships were and got in one nor how he liked the sea nor about the hardships of a sailorps life and it must have been hardship indeed for himp a boy of fourteen or fifteen who had never seen the ocean beforep going to sea in 1823p he just saidp pso i went to the west indiespp sitting there on the log with grandfather while the dogs still bayed the tree where they believed the architect was because he would have to be there p saying it just like that day thirty years later when he sat in grandfatherps office pin his fine clothes nowp even though they were a little soiled and worn with three years of warp with money to rattle in his pocket and his beard at its prime toop beard body and intellect at that peak which all the different parts that make a man reachp where he can say i did all that i set out to do and i could stop here if i wanted to and no man to chide me with slothp not even myself p and maybe this the instant which fate always picks out to blackjack youp only the peak feels so sound and stable that the beginning of the falling is hidden for a little while p with his head flung up a little in that attitude that nobody ever knew exactly who he had aped it from or if he did not perhaps learn it too from the same book out of which he taught himself the wordsp the bombastic phrases with which grandfather said he even asked you for a match for his cigar or offered you the cigar p and nothing of vanityp nothing comic in it either grandfather saidp because of that innocence which he had never lost because after it finally told him what to do that night he forgot about it and didnpt know that he still had itp and told grandfather p told himp mindp not excusingp asking for no pityp not explainingp asking for no exculpationp just told grandfather how he had put his first wife aside like eleventh and twelfth century kings didp pi found that she was not and could never bep through no fault of her ownp adjunctive or incremental to the design which i had in mindp so i provided for her and put her asidepp p telling grandfather in that same tone while they sat on the log waiting for the niggers to come back with the other guests and the whiskeyp pso i went to the west indiesp i had had some schooling during a part of one winterp enough to have learned something about themp to realise that they would be most suitable to the expediency of my requirementspp he didnpt remember how he came to go to the schoolp that isp why his father decided all of a sudden to send himp what nebulous vision or shape might have evolved out of the fog of alcohol and niggerpbeating and scheming to avoid work which his old man called his mind p the image not of ambition nor gloryp not to see his son better himself for his own sakep probably not even some blind instant of revolt against that same house whose roof had leaked on probably a hundred families like his which had come and lived beneath it and vanished and left no tracep nothingp not even rags and broken crockeryp but was probably mere vindictive envy toward one or two menp plantersp whom he had to see every now and thenp anywayp he was sent to school for about three months one winter p an adolescent boy of thirteen or fourteen in a room full of children three or four years younger than he and three or four years further advancedp and he not only probably bigger than the teacher pthe kind of teacher that would be teaching a oneproom country school in a nest of tidewater plantationsp but a good deal more of a manp who probably brought into the school with him along with his sober watchful mountain reserve a good deal of latent insubordination that he would not be aware of any more than he would be aware at first that the teacher was afraid of himp it would not be intractability and maybe you couldnpt call it pride eitherp but maybe just the self reliance of mountains and solitudep since some of his blood at least phis mother was a mountain womanp a scottish woman whop so he told grandfatherp never did quite learn to speak englishp had been bred in mountainsp but whichp whatever it wasp was that which forbade him to condescend to memorise dry sums and such but which did permit him to listen when the teacher read aloudp p sent to schoolp pwherepp he told grandfatherp pi learned little save that most of the deedsp good and bad bothp incurring opprobrium or plaudits or reward eitherp within the scope of manps abilitiesp had already been performed and were to be learned about only from booksp so i listened when he would read to usp i realise now that on most of these occasions he resorted to reading aloud only when he saw that the moment had come when his entire school was on the point of rising and leaving the roomp but whatever the reasonp he read to us and i anyway listenedp though i did not know that in that listening i was equipping myself better for what i should later design to do than if i had learned all the addition and subtraction in the bookp that was how i learned of the west indiesp not where they werep though if i had known at the time that that knowledge would someday serve mep i would have learned that toop what i learned was that there was a place called the west indies to which poor men went in ships and became richp it didnpt matter howp so long as that man was clever and courageousp the latter of which i believed that i possessedp the former of which i believed thatp if it were to be learned by energy and will in the school of endeavor and experiencep i should learnp i remember how i remained one afternoon when school was out and waited for the teacherp waylaid him phe was a smallish man who always looked dustyp as if he had been born and lived all his life in attics and store roomsp and stepped outp i recall how he started back when he saw me and how i thought at the time that if i were to strike him there would be no resulting outcry but merely the sound of the blow and a puff of dust in the air as when you strike a rug hanging from a linep i asked him if it were truep if what he had read us about the men who got rich in the west indies were truep pwhy notpp he answeredp starting backp pdidnpt you hear me read it from the bookpp p phow do i know that what you read was in the bookpp i saidp i was that greenp that countrifiedp you seep i had not then learned to read my own namep although i had been attending the school for almost three monthsp i daresay i knew no more than i did when i entered the schoolroom for the first timep but i had to knowp you seep perhaps a man builds for his future in more ways than onep builds not only toward the body which will be his tomorrow or next yearp but toward actions and the subsequent irrevocable courses of resultant action which his weak senses and intellect cannot foresee but which ten or twenty or thirty years from now he will takep will have to take in order to survive the actp perhaps it was that instinct and not i who grasped one of his arms as he drew back pi did not actually doubt himp i think that even thenp even at my agep i realised that he could not have invented itp that he lacked that something which is necessary in a man to enable him to fool even a child by lyingp but you seep i had to be surep had to take whatever method that came to my hand to make surep and there was nothing else to hand except himp glaring at me and beginning to strugglep and i holding him and saying p i was quite calmp quite calmp i just had to know p sayingp psuppose i went there and found out that it was not sopp and he shrieking nowp shouting phelpp helppp so that i let him gop so when the time came when i realised that to accomplish my design i should need first of all and above all things money in considerable quantities and in the quite immediate futurep i remembered what he had read to us and i went to the west indiespp pthen the other guests began to ride upp and after a while the niggers came back with the coffee pot and a deer haunch and the whiskey pand one bottle of champagne which they had overlookedp grandfather saidp and he stopped talking for a whilep he didnpt tell anymore of it until they had eaten and were sitting around smoking while the niggers and the dogs pthey had to drag the dogs away from the treep but especially away from the sapling pole with the architectps suspenders tied to itp as if it was not only that the pole was the last thing the architect had touched but it was the thing his exultation had touched when he saw another chance to elude themp and so it was not only the man but the exultation too which the dogs smelled that made them wildp made casts in all directionsp getting further and further away until just before sundown one of the niggers whooped and he phe hadnpt spoken for some timep grandfather saidp lying there on one elbowp in the fine boots and the only pants he had and the shirt he had put on when he came out of the mud and washed himself off after he realised that he would have to hunt the architect down himself if he wanted him back alive probablyp not talking himself and maybe not even listening while the men talked about cotton and politicsp just smoking the cigar grandfather had given him and looking at the fire embers and maybe making that west indian voyage again that he had made when he was fourteen and didnpt even know where he was going or if he would ever get there or notp no more way of knowing whether the men who said the ship was going there were lying or not than he had of knowing whether or not the school teacher was telling the truth about what was in the bookp and he never told whether the voyage was hard or notp how much he must have had to endure to make itp which of course he did have to endurep but then he believed that all necessary was courage and shrewdness and the one he knew he had and the other he believed he could learn if it were to be taughtp and it probably the hardship of the voyage which comforted him that the men who said the ship was going to the west indies had not lied to him because at that timep grandfather saidp he probably could not have believed in anything that was easypp p he saidp pthere it isp and got up and they all went on and found where the architect had come back to the ground againp with a gain of almost three hoursp so they had to go fast now and there wasnpt much time to talkp or at leastp grandfather saidp he did not appear to intend to resumep then the sun went down and the other men had to start back to townp they all went except grandfatherp because he wanted to listen some morep so he sent word in by one of the others phe was not married then eitherp that he would not be homep and he and sutpen went on until the light failedp two of the niggers pthey were thirteen miles from sutpenps camp thenp had already gone back to get blankets and more grubp then it was dark and the niggers began to light pine knots and they went on for a little while yetp gaining what they could now since they knew that the architect would have had to den soon after dark to keep from traveling in a circlep that was how grandfather remembered itp he and sutpen leading their horses phe would look back now and then and see the horsesp eyes shining in the torch light and the horsesp heads tossing and the shadows slipping along their shoulders and flanksp and the dogs and the niggers pthe niggers mostly still naked except for a pair of pants here and therep with the pine torches smoking and flaring above them and the red light on their round heads and arms and the mud they wore in the swamp to keep the mosquitoes off dried hard and shinyp glinting like glass or china and the shadows they cast taller than they were at one moment then gone the next and even the trees and brakes and thickets there one moment and gone the next though you knew all the time that they were still there because you could feel them with your breathingp as thoughp invisiblep they pressed down and condensed the invisible air you breathedp and he said how sutpen was talking about it againp telling him again before he realised that this was some more of itp and he said how he thought how there was something about a manps destiny por about the manp that caused the destiny to shape itself to him like his clothes didp like the same coat that new might have fitted a thousand menp yet after one man has worn it for a while it fits no one else and you can tell it anywhere you see it even if all you see is a sleeve or a lapelp so that his p p ppthe demonpspp shreve saidp p p destiny had fitted itself to himp to his innocencep his pristine aptitude for platform drama and childlike heroic simplicity just as the fine broadcloth uniform which you could have seen on ten thousand men during those four yearsp which he wore when he came in the office on that afternoon thirty years later had fitted itself to the swaggering of all his gestures and to the forensic verbiage in which he stated calmlyp with that frank innocence which we call pof a childp except that a human child is the only living creature that is never either frank or innocentp the most simple and the most outrageous thingsp he was telling some more of itp already into what he was telling yet still without telling how he got to where he was nor even how what he was now involved in pobviously at least twenty years old nowp crouching behind a window in the dark and firing the muskets through it which someone else loaded and handed to himp came to occurp getting himself and grandfather both into that besieged haitian room as simply as he got himself to the west indies by saying that he decided to go to the west indies and so he went therep this anecdote no deliberate continuation of the other one but merely called to his mind by the picture of the niggers and torches in front of themp he not telling how he got therep what had happened during the six years between that day when hep a boy of fourteen who knew no tongue but english and not much of thatp had decided to go to the west indies and become richp and this night whenp overseer or foreman or something to a french sugar planterp he was barricade in the house with the planterps family pand now grandfather said there was the first mention p a shadow that almost emerged for a moment and then faded again but not completely away p of the p  p p ppitps a girlpp shreve saidp pdont tell mep just go onppp p p whom he was to tell grandfather thirty years afterward he had found unsuitable to his purpose and so put asidep though providing for herp and a few frightened halfpbreed servants which he would have to turn from the window from time to time and kick and curse into helping the girl load the muskets which he and the planter fired through the windowsp and i reckon grandfather was saying pwait wait for godps sake waitp about like you are until he finally did stop and back up and start over again with at least some regard for cause and effect even if none for logical sequence and continuityp or maybe it was the fact that they were sitting again nowp having decided that they had gone far enough for that nightp and the niggers had made camp and cooked supper and they phe and grandfatherp drank some of the whiskey and ate and then sat before the fire drinking some more of the whiskey and he telling it all over and still it was not absolutely clear p the how and the why he was there and what he was p since he was not talking about himselfp he was telling a storyp he was not bragging about something he had donep he was just telling a story about something a man named thomas sutpen had experiencedp which would still have been the same story if the man had had no name at allp if it had been told about any man or no man over whiskey at nightp pthat may have been what slowed him downp but it was not enough to clarify the story muchp he still was not recounting to grandfather the career of somebody named thomas sutpenp grandfather said the only mention he ever made to those six or seven years which must have existed somewherep must have actually occurredp was about the patois he had to learn in order to oversee the plantationp and the french he had to learnp maybe not to get engaged to be marriedp but which he would certainly need to be able to repudiate the wife after he had already got her p howp so he told grandfatherp he had believed that courage and shrewdness would be enough but found that he was wrong and how sorry he was that he had not taken the schooling along with the west indian lore when he discovered that all people did not speak the same tongue and realised that he would not only need courage and skillp he would have to learn to speak a new languagep else that design to which he had dedicated himself would die stillpbornp so he learned the language just like he learned to be a sailor i reckonp because grandfather asked him why he didnpt get himself a girl to live with and learn it the easy way and grandfather said how he sat there with the firelight on his face and the beard and his eyes quiet and sort of brightp and said p and grandfather said it was the only time he ever knew him to say anything quiet and simplep pon this night i am speaking of pand until my first marriagep i might addp i was still a virginp you will probably not believe thatp and if i were to try to explain it you would disbelieve me more than everp so i will only say that that too was a part of the design which i had in my mindp and grandfather saidp pwhy shouldnpt i believe itpp and he looking at grandfather still with that quiet bright expression about the eyesp sayingp pbut do youp surely you dont hold me in such small contempt as to believe that at twenty i could neither have suffered temptation nor offered itpp and grandfather saidp pyoupre rightp i shouldnpt believe itp but i dopp so it was no tale about womenp and certainly not about lovep the womanp the girlp just that shadow which could load a musket but could not have been trusted to fire one out the window that night por the seven or eight nights while they huddled in the dark and watched from the windows the barns or granaries or whatever it is you harvest sugar intop and the fields toop blazing and smokingp he said how you could smell itp you could smell nothing elsep the rank sweet rich smell as if the hatred and the implacabilityp the thousand secret dark years which had created the hatred and implacabilityp had intensified the smell of the sugarp and grandfather said how he remembered then that he had seen sutpen each time decline sugar for his coffee and so he pgrandfatherp knew why now but he asked anyway to be sure and sutpen told him it was truep that he had not been afraid until after the fields and barns were all burned and they had even forgot about the smell of the burning sugarp but that he had never been able to bear sugar sincep p the girl just emerging for a second of the tellingp in a single word almostp so that grandfather said it was like he had just seen her too for a second by the flash of one of the muskets p a bent facep a single cheekp a chin for an instant beyond a curtain of fallen hairp a white slender arm raisedp a delicate hand clutching a ramrodp and that was allp no more detail and information about that than about how he got from the fieldp his overseeingp into the besieged house when the niggers rushed at him with their machetesp than how he got from the rotting cabin in virginia to the fields he oversawp and thisp grandfather saidp more incredible to him than the getting there from virginia because that did infer timep a space the getting across which did indicate something of leisureliness since time is longer than any distancep while the otherp the getting from the fields into the barricaded housep seemed to have occurred with a sort of violent abrogation which must have been almost as short as his telling about it p a very condensation of time which was the gauge of its own violencep and he telling it in that pleasant faintly forensic anecdotal manner apparently just as he remembered itp was impressed by it through detached and impersonal interest and curiosity which even fear pthat once when he mentioned fear by that same inverse process of speaking of a time when he was not afraidp before he became afraidp he put itp failed to leaven very muchp because he was not afraid until after it was all overp grandfather saidp because that was all it was to him p a spectaclep something to be watched because he might not have a chance to see such againp since his innocence still functioned and he not only did not know what fear was until afterwardp he did not even know that at first he was not terrifiedp did not even know that he had found the place where money was to be had quick if you were courageous and shrewd phe did not mean shrewdnessp grandfather saidp what he meant was unscrupulousness only he didnpt know that word because it would not have been in the book from which the school teacher readp or maybe that was what he meant by couragep grandfather saidp but where high mortality was concomitant with the money and the sheen on the dollars was not from gold but from blood p a spot of earth which might have been created and set aside by heaven itselfp grandfather saidp as a theatre for violence and injustice and bloodshed and all the satanic lusts of human greed and crueltyp for the last despairing fury of all the pariahpinterdict and all the doomed p a little island set in a smiling and furyplurked and incredible indigo seap which was the halfway point between what we call the jungle and what we call civilizationp halfway between the dark inscrutable continent from which the black bloodp the black bones and flesh and thinking and remembering and hopes and desiresp was ravished by violencep and the cold known land to which it was doomedp the civilised land and people which had expelled some of its own blood and thinking and desires that had become too crass to be faced and borne longerp and set it homeless and desperate on the lonely ocean p a little lost island in a latitude which would require ten thousand years of equatorial heritage to bear its climatep a soil manured with black blood from two hundred years of oppression and exploitation until it sprang with an incredible paradox of peaceful greenery and crimson flowers and sugar cane sapling size and three times the height of a man and a little bulkier of course but valuable pound for pound almost with silver orep as if nature held a balance and kept a book and offered a recompense for the torn limbs and outraged hearts even if man did notp the planting of nature and man too watered not only by the wasted blood but breathed over by the winds in which the doomed ships had fled in vainp out of which the last tatter of sail had sunk into the blue seap along which the last vain despairing cry of woman or child had blown awayp p the planting of men toop the yet intact bones and brains in which the old unsleeping blood that had vanished into the earth they trod still cried out for vengeancep and he overseeing itp riding peacefully about on his horse while he learned the language pthat meagre and fragile threadp grandfather saidp by which the little surface corners and edges of menps secret and solitary lives may be joined for an instant now and then before sinking back into the darkness where the spirit cried for the first time and was not heard and will cry for the last time and will not be heard then eitherpp not knowing that what he rode upon was a volcanop hearing the air tremble and throb at night with the drums and the chanting and not knowing that it was the heart of the earth itself he heardp who believed pgrandfather saidp that earth was kind and gentle and that darkness was merely something you sawp or could not see inp overseeing what he oversaw and not knowing that he was overseeing itp making his daily expeditions from an armed citadel until the day itself camep and he not telling that eitherp how that day happenedp the steps leading up to it because grandfather said he apparently did not knowp comprehendp what he must have been seeing every day because of that innocence p a pigps bone with a little rotten flesh still clinging to itp a few chicken feathersp a stained dirty rag with a few pebbles tied up in it found on the old manps pillow one morning and none knew pleast of allp the planter himself who had been asleep on the pillowp how it had come there because they learned at the same time that all the servantsp the half breedsp were missingp and he did not know until the planter told him that the stains on the rag were neither dirt nor grease but bloodp nor that what he took to be the planterps gallic rage was actually fearp terrorp and he just curious and quite interested because he still looked upon the planter and the daughter both phe told grandfather how until that first night of the siege he had not once thought that he did not know the girlps christian namep whether he had ever heard it or notp he also told grandfatherp dropped this into the telling as you might flick the joker out of a pack of fresh cards without being able to remember later whether you had removed the joker or notp that the old manps wife had been a spaniardp and so it was grandfather and not sutpen who realised that until that first night of the attack he had possibly not seen the girl as much as a dozen timesp as foreignersp p the body of one of the half breeds found at last phe found itp hunted for it for two days without even knowing that what he was meeting was a blank wall of black secret facesp a wall behind which almost anything could be preparing to happen andp as he learned laterp almost anything wasp and on the third day found the body where he could not possibly have missed it during the first hour of the first day if it had been therep and he sitting on the logp grandfather saidp telling itp making the gestures to tell it withp whom grandfather himself had seen fight naked chest to chest with one of his wild niggers by the light of the camp fire while his house was building and who still fought with them by lantern light in the stable after he had got at last that wife who would be adjunctive to the forwarding of that design he had in mindp and no bones about the fighting eitherp no handshaking and gratulations while he washed the blood off and donned his shirt because at the end of it the nigger would be flat on his back with his chest heaving and another nigger throwing water on himp p sitting there and telling grandfather how at last he found the half breedp or what used to be the half breedp and that he psutpenp had seen as much as most men and had done as much as mostp including some things which he did not boast aboutp but that there were some things which a man who pretended to be civilised saw when he had to but which he did not talk aboutp so he would only say that he found the half breed at last and so began to comprehend that the situation might become seriousp then the housep the barricadep the five of them p the planterp the daughterp two women servants and himself p shut up in it and the air filled with the smoke and smell of burning cane and the glare and smoke of it on the sky and the air throbbing and trembling with the drums and the chanting p the little lost island beneath its downpcupped bowl of alternating day and night like a vacuum into which no help could comep where not even winds from the outer world came but only the tradesp the same weary winds blowing back and forth across it and burdened still with the weary voices of murdered women and children homeless and graveless about the isolating and solitary sea p while the two servants and the girl whose christian name he did not yet know loaded the muskets which he and the father fired at no enemy but at the haitian night itselfp lancing their little vain and puny flashes into the brooding and bloodpweary and throbbing darknessp and it the very time of yearp the season between hurricanes and any hope of rainp and how on the eighth night the water gave out and something had to be done so he put the musket down and went out and subdued themp that was how he told itp he went out and subdued themp and when he returned he and the girl became engaged to marry and grandfather saying pwait waitp sure enough nowp sayingp pbut you didnpt even know herp you told me that when the siege began you didnpt even know her namep and he looked at grandfather and saidp pyesp but you seep it took me some time to recoverpp not how he did itp he didnpt tell that eitherp that of no moment to the story eitherp he just put the musket down and had someone unbar the door and then bar it behind himp and walked out into the darkness and subdued themp maybe by yelling louderp maybe by standingp bearing more than they believed any bones and flesh could or should pshouldp yesp that would be the terrible thingp to find flesh to stand more than flesh should be asked to standpp maybe at last they themselves turning in horror and fleeing from the white arms and legs shaped like theirs and from which blood could be made to spurt and flow as it could from theirs and containing an indomitable spirit which should have come from the same primary fire which theirs came from but which could not havep could not possibly have phe showed grandfather the scarsp one of whichp grandfather saidp came pretty near leaving him that virgin for the rest of his life toop and then daylight came with no drums in it for the first time in eight daysp and they emerged pprobably the man and the daughterp and walked across the burned land with the bright sun shining down on it as if nothing had happenedp walking now in what must have been an incredible desolate solitude and peaceful quietp and found him and brought him to the housep and when he recovered he and the girl were engagedp then he stoppedpp pall rightpp shreve saidp pgo onpp pi said he stoppedpp quentin saidp pi heard youp stopped whatp how got engaged and then stopped yet still had a wife to repudiate laterp you said he didnpt remember how he got to haitip and then he didnpt remember how he got into the house with the niggers surrounding itp now are you going to tell me he didnpt even remember getting marriedp that he got engaged and then he decided he would stopp only one day he found out he hadnpt stopped but on the contrary he was marriedp and all you called him was just a virginpp phe stopped talkingp telling itpp quentin saidp he had not movedp talking apparently pif to anythingp to the letter lying on the open book on the table between his handsp opposite him shreve had filled the pipe and smoked it out againp it lay again overturnedp a scattering of white ashes fanning out from the bowlp onto the table before his crossed naked arms with which he appeared at the same time both to support and hug himselfp since although it was only eleven oclock the room was beginning to cool toward that point where about midnight there would be only enough heat in the radiators to keep the pipes from freezingp though phe would not perform his deeppbreathing in the open window tonight at allp he had yet to go to the bedroom and return first with his bathrobe on and next with his overcoat on top of the bathrobe and quentinps overcoat on his armp phe just said that he was now engaged to be married and then he stopped telling itp he just stoppedp grandfather saidp flat and final like thatp like that was all there wasp all there could be to itp all of it that made good listening from one man to another over whiskey at nightp maybe it waspp his pquentinpsp face was loweredp he spoke still in that curiousp that almost sullen flat tone which had caused shreve to watch him from the beginning with intent detached speculation and curiosityp to watch him still from behind his pshrevepsp expression of cherubic and erudite amazement which the spectacles intensified or perhaps actually createdp phe just got up and looked at the whiskey bottle and saidp pno more tonightp wepll get to sleepp we want to get an early start tomorrowp maybe we can catch him before he limbers uppp pbut they didnptp it was late afternoon before they caught him p the architect i mean p and then only because he had hurt his leg trying to architect himself across the riverp but he made a mistake in the calculation this time so the dogs and the niggers bayed him and the niggers making the racket now pgrandfather said how maybe the niggers believed that by fleeing the architect had voluntarily surrendered his status as interdict meatp had voluntarily offered the gambit by fleeingp which the niggers had accepted by chasing him and won by catching himp and that now they would be allowed to cook and eat himp both victors and vanquished accepting this in the same spirit of sport and sportsmanship and no rancor or hard feelings on either sidep as they hauled him out pall the men who had started the race yesterday had come back except threep and the ones that returned had brought othersp so there were more of them now than when the race startedp grandfather saidp p hauled him out of his cave under the river bankp a little man with one sleeve missing from his frock coat and his flowered vest ruined by water and mud where he had fallen in the river and one pants leg ripped down so they could see where he had tied up his leg with a piece of his shirt tail and the rag bloody and the leg swollenp and his hat was completely gonep they never did find it so grandfather gave him a new hat the day he left when the house was finishedp it was in grandfatherps office and grandfather said the architect took the new hat and looked at it and burst into tearsp p a little harried wildpfaced man with a twopdaysp stubble of beardp who came out of the cave fighting like a wildcatp hurt leg and allp with the dogs barking and the niggers whooping and hollering with deadly and merry anticipationp like they were under the impression that since the race had lasted more than twentypfour hours the rules would be automatically abrogated and they would not have to wait to cook him until sutpen waded in with a short stick and beat niggers and dogs all awayp leaving the architect standing therep not scared worth a damn eitherp just panting a little and grandfather said a little sick in the face where the niggers had mishandled his leg in the heat of the capturep and making them a speech in frenchp a long one and so fast that grandfather said probably another frenchman could not have understood all of itp but it sounded finep grandfather said even he p all of them p could tell that the architect was not apologisingp it was finep grandfather saidp and he said how sutpen turned toward him but he pgrandfatherp was already approaching the architectp holding out the bottle of whiskey already uncorkedp and grandfather saw the eyes in the gaunt facep the eyes desperate and hopeless but indomitable toop invincible toop not beaten yet by a damn sight grandfather saidp and all that fiftypodd hours of dark and swamp and sleeplessness and fatigue and no grub and nowhere to go and no hope of getting therep just a will to endure and a foreknowing of defeat but not beat yet by a damn sightp and he took the bottle in one of his little dirty coonplike hands and raised the other hand and even fumbled about his head for a second before he remembered that the hat was gonep then flung the hand up in a gesture that grandfather said you simply could not describep that seemed to gather all misfortune and defeat that the human race ever suffered into a little pinch in his fingers like dust and fling it backward over his headp and raised the bottle and bowed first to grandfather then to all the other men sitting their horses in a circle and looking at himp and then he took not only the first drink of neat whiskey he ever took in his life but the drink of it that he could no more have conceived himself taking than the brahmin can believe that that situation can conceivably arise in which he will eat dogpp quentin ceasedp at once shreve saidp pall rightp dont bother to say he stopped nowp just go onpp but quentin did not continue at once p the flatp curiously dead voicep the downcast facep the relaxed body not stirring except to breathep the two of them not moving except to breathep both youngp both born within the same yearp the one in albertap the other in mississippip born half a continent apart yet joinedp connected after a fashion in a sort of geographical transubstantiation by that continental troughp that river which runs not only through the physical land of which it is the geologic umbilicalp not only runs through the spiritual lives of the beings within its scopep but is very environment itself which laughs at degrees of latitude and temperaturep though some of these beingsp like shrevep have never seen it p the two of them who four months ago had never laid eyes on one another yet who since had slept in the same room and eaten side by side of the same food and used the same books from which to prepare to recite in the same freshman coursesp facing one another across the lamplit table on which lay the fragile pandoraps box of scrawled paper which had filled with violent and unratiocinative djinns and demons this snug monastic coignp this dreamy and heatless alcove of what we call the best of thoughtp pjust dont botherpp shreve saidp pjust get on with itpp pthat would take thirty yearspp quentin saidp pit was thirty years before he told grandfather any more of itp maybe he was too busyp all his time for spare talking taken up with furthering that design which he had in mindp and his only relaxation fighting his wild niggers in the stable where the men could hitch their horses and come up from the back and not be seen from the house because he was already married nowp his house finished and he already arrested for stealing it and freed again so that was all settledp with a wife and two children p nop three p in it and his land cleared and planted with the seed grandfather loaned him and him getting rich good and steady now p  p p pyespp shreve saidp pmr coldfieldp what was thatpp pi dont knowpp quentin saidp pnobody ever did know for certainp it was something about a bill of ladingp some way he persuaded mr coldfield to use his creditp one of those things that when they work you were smart and when they dont you change your name and move to texasp and father said how mr coldfield must have sat back there in his little store and watched his wagonload of stock double maybe every ten years or at least not lose any ground and seen the chance to do that very same thing all the timep only his conscience pnot his couragep father said he had plenty of thatp wouldnpt let himp then sutpen came along and offered to do itp he and mr coldfield to divide the loot if it workedp and he psutpenp to take all the blame if it didnptp and mr coldfield let himp father said it was because mr coldfield did not believe it would workp that they would get away with itp only he couldnpt quit thinking about itp and so when they tried it and it failed he pmr coldfieldp would be able to get it out of his mind thenp and that when it did fail and they were caughtp mr coldfield would insist on taking his share of the blame as penance and expiation for having sinned in his mind all those yearsp because mr coldfield never did believe it would workp so when he saw that it was going to workp had workedp the least thing he could do was to refuse to take his share of the profitsp that when he saw that it had worked it was his conscience he hatedp not sutpenp p his conscience and the landp the country which had created his conscience and then offered the opportunity to have made all that money to the conscience which it had createdp which could do nothing but declinep hated that country so much that he was even glad when he saw it drifting closer and closer to a doomed and fatal warp that he would have joined the yankee armyp father saidp only he was not a soldier and knew that he would either be killed or die of hardship and so not be present on that day when the south would realise that it was now paying the price for having erected its economic edifice not on the rock of stern morality but on the shifting sands of opportunism and moral brigandagep so he chose the only gesture he could think of to impress his disapproval on those who should outlive the fighting and so participate in the remorse p p psurepp shreve saidp pthatps finep but sutpenp the designp get onp nowpp pyespp quentin saidp pthe designp p getting richer and richerp it must have looked fine and clear ahead for him nowp house finishedp and even bigger and whiter than the one he had gone to the door of that day and the nigger came in his monkey clothes and told him to go to the backp and he with his own brand of niggers evenp which the man who lay in the hammock with his shoes off didnpt havep to cull one from and train him to go to the door when his turn came for a little boy without any shoes on and with his papps cutdown pants for clothes to come and knock on itp only father said that that wasnpt it nowp that when he came to grandfatherps office that day after the thirty yearsp and not trying to excuse now anymore than he had tried in the bottom that night when they ran the architectp but just to explain nowp trying hard to explain now because now he was old and knew itp knew it was being old that he had to talk againstp time shortening ahead of him that could and would do things to his chances and possibilities even if he had no more doubt of his bones and flesh than he did of his will and couragep telling grandfather that the boypsymbol at the door wasnpt it because the boypsymbol was just the figment of the amazed and desperate childp that now he would take that boy in where he would never again need to stand on the outside of a white door and knock at itp and not at all for mere shelter but so that that boyp that whatever nameless strangerp could shut that door himself forever behind him on all that he had ever knownp and look ahead along the still undivulged light rays in which his descendants who might not even ever hear his pthe boypsp namep waited to be born without even having to know that they had once been riven forever free from brutehood just as his own psutpenpsp children were p  p p pdont say itps just me that sounds like your old manpp shreve saidp pbut go onp sutpenps childrenp go onpp pyespp quentin saidp pthe two childrenp thinking yesp maybe we are both fatherp maybe nothing ever happens once and is finishedp maybe happen is never once but like ripples maybe on water after the pebble sinksp the ripples moving onp spreadingp the pool attached by a narrow umbilical waterpcord to the next pool which the first pool feedsp has

doesnpt matterp that pebbleps watery echo whose fall it did not even see moves across its surface too at the original ripplepspacep to the old ineradicable rhythm thinking yesp we are both fatherp or maybe father and i are both shrevep maybe it took father and me both to make shreve or shreve and me both to make father or maybe thomas sutpen to make all of usp pyesp the two childrenp the son and the daughter by sex and age so glib to the design that he might have planned that toop by character mental and physical so glib to it that he might have culled them out of the celestial herd of seraphs and cherubim like he chose his twenty niggers out of whatever swapping there must have been when he repudiated that first wife and that child when he discovered that they would not be adjunctive to the forwarding of the designp and grandfather said there was no conscience about thatp that sutpen sat in the office that afternoon after thirty years and told him how his conscience had bothered him somewhat at first but that he had argued calmly and logically with his conscience until it was settledp just as he must have argued with his conscience about his and mr coldfieldps bill of lading ponly probably not as long herep since time here would be pressingp until that was settledp p how he granted that by certain lights there was injustice in what he did but that he had obviated that as much as lay in his power by being abovepboard in the matterp that he could have simply deserted herp could have taken his hat and walked outp but he did notp and that he had what grandfather would have to admit was a good and valid claimp if not to the whole place which he alone had savedp as well as the lives of all the white people on itp at least to that portion of it which had been specifically described and deeded to him in the marriage settlement which he had entered in good faithp with no reservations as to his obscure origin and material equipmentp while there had been not only reservation but actual misrepresentation on their part and misrepresentation of such a crass nature as to have not only voided and frustrated without his knowing it the central motivation of his entire designp but would have made an ironic delusion of all that he had suffered and endured in the past and all that he could ever accomplish in the future toward that design p which claim he had voluntarily relinquishedp taking only the twenty niggers out of all he might have claimed and which many another man in his place would have insisted upon keeping and pin which contentionp would have been supported by both legal and moral sanction even if not the delicate one of consciencep and grandfather not saying pwait waitp now because it was that innocence againp that innocence which believed that the ingredients of morality were like the ingredients of pie or cake and once you had measured them and balanced them and mixed them and put them into the oven it was all finished and nothing but pie or cake could come outp p yesp sitting there in grandfatherps office trying to explain with that patient amazed recapitulationp not to grandfather and not to himself because grandfather said that his very calmness was indication that he had long since given up any hope of ever understanding itp but trying to explain to circumstancep to fate itselfp the logical steps by which he had arrived at a result absolutely and forever incrediblep repeating the clear and simple synopsis of his history pwhich he and grandfather both now knewp as if he were trying to explain it to an intractable and unpredictable childp pyou seep i had a design in my mindp whether it was a good or a bad design is beside the pointp the question isp where did i make the mistake in itp what did i do or misdo in itp whom or what injure by it to the extent which this would indicatep i had a designp to accomplish it i should require moneyp a housep a plantationp slavesp a family p incidentally of coursep a wifep i set out to acquire thesep asking no favor of any manp i even risked my life at one timep as i told youp though as i also told you i did not undertake this risk purely and simply to gain a wifep though it did have that resultp but that is beside the point alsop suffice that i had the wifep accepted her in good faithp with no reservations about myselfp and i expected as much from themp i did not even demandp mindp as one of my obscure origin might have been expected to do por at least be condoned in the doingp out of ignorance of gentility in dealing with gentleborn peoplep i did not demandp i accepted them at their own valuation while insisting on my own part upon explaining fully about myself and my progenitorsp yet they deliberately withheld from me the one fact which i have reason to know they were aware would have caused me to decline the entire matterp otherwise they would not have withheld it from me p a fact which i did not learn until after my son was bornp and even then i did not act hastilyp i could have reminded them of these wasted yearsp these years which would now leave me behind with my schedule not only the amount of elapsed time which their number representedp but that compensatory amount of time represented by their number which i should now have to spend to advance myself once more to the point i had reached and lostp but i did notp i merely explained how this new fact rendered it impossible that this woman and child be incorporated in my designp and following whichp as i told youp i made no attempt to keep not only that which i might consider myself to have earned at the risk of my life but which had been given to me by signed testimonialsp but on the contrary i declined and resigned all right and claim to this in order that i might repair whatever injustice i might be considered to have done by so providing for the two persons whom i might be considered to have deprived of anything i might later possessp and this was agreed top mindp agreed to between the two partiesp and yetp after more than thirty yearsp more than thirty years after my conscience had finally assured me that if i had done an injusticep i had done what i could to rectify it p  p p and grandfather not saying wait now but sayingp hollering maybe evenp pconsciencep consciencep good godp manp what else did you expectp didnpt the very affinity and instinct for misfortune of a man who had spent that much time in a monastery evenp let alone one who had lived that many years as you lived themp tell you better than thatp didnpt the dread and fear of females which you must have drawn in with the primary mammalian milk teach you betterp what kind of abysmal and purblind innocence could that have been which someone told you to call virginityp what conscience to trade with which would have warranted you in the belief that you could have bought immunity from her for no other coin but justicepp p  p p it was at this point that shreve went to the bedroom and put on the bathrobep he did not say waitp he just rose and left quentin sitting before the tablep the open book and the letterp and went out and returned in the robe and sat again and took up the cold pipep though without filling it anew or lighting it as it wasp pall rightpp he saidp pso that christmas henry brought him homep into the housep and the demon looked up and saw the face he believed he had paid off and discharged twentypeight years agop go onpp pyespp quentin saidp pfather said he probably named him himselfp charles bonp charles goodp he didnpt tell grandfather that he didp but grandfather believed he didp would havep that would have been a part of the cleaning upp just as he would have done his share toward cleaning up the exploded caps and musket cartridges after the siege if he hadnpt been sick por maybe engagedpp he would have insisted on it maybep the conscience again which could not allow her and the child any place in the design even though he could have closed his eyes andp if not fooled the rest of the world as they had fooled himp at least have frightened any man out of speaking the secret aloud p the same conscience which would not permit the childp since it was a boyp to bear either his name or that of its maternal grandfatherp yet which would also forbid him to do the customary and provide a quick husband for the discarded woman and so give his son an authentic namep he chose the name himselfp grandfather believedp just as he named them all p the charles goodsp and the clytemnestras and henry and judith and all of them p that entire fecundity of dragonsp teeth as father called itp and father said p  p p pyour fatherpp shreve saidp phe seems to have got an awful lot of delayed information awful quickp after having waited fortypfive yearsp if he knew all thisp what was his reason for telling you that the trouble between henry and bon was the octoroon womanpp phe didnpt know it thenp grandfather didnpt tell him all of it eitherp like sutpen never told grandfather quite all of itpp pthen who did tell himpp pi didpp quentin did not movep did not look up while shreve watched himp pthe day after we p  p after that night when we p  p p pohpp shreve saidp pafter you and the old auntp i seep go onp and father said p  p p p p said how he must have stood there on the front gallery that afternoon and waited for henry and the friend henry had been writing home about all fall to come up the drivep and that maybe after henry wrote the name in the first letter sutpen probably told himself it couldnpt bep that there was a limit even to irony beyond which it became either just vicious but not fatal horseplay or harmless coincidencep since father said that even sutpen probably knew that nobody yet ever invented a name that somebody didnpt own now or hadnpt owned oncep and they rode up at last and henry saidp pfatherp this is charlesp and he p  p p ppthe demonpp shreve saidp p p  p saw the face and knew that there are situations where coincidence is no more than the little child that rushes out onto a football field to take part in the game and the players run over and around the unscathed head and go on and shock together and in the fury of the struggle for the facts called gain or loss nobody even remembers the child nor saw who came and snatched it back from dissolutionp p that he stood there at his own doorp just as he had imaginedp plannedp designedp and sure enough and after fifty years the forlorn nameless and homeless lost child came to knock at it and no monkeypdressed nigger anywhere under the sun to come to the door and order the child awayp and father said that even thenp even though he knew that bon and judith had never laid eyes on one anotherp he must have felt and heard the design p housep positionp posterity and all p come down like it had been built out of smokep making no soundp creating no rush of displaced air and not even leaving any debrisp and he not calling it retributionp no sins of the father come home to roostp not even calling it bad luckp but just a mistakep that mistake which he could not discover himself and which he came to grandfatherp not to excuse but just to review the facts for an impartial pand grandfather said he believedp a legally trainedp mind to examine and find and point out to himp not moral retribution you seep just an old mistake in fact which a man of courage and shrewdness pthe one of which he now knew he possessedp the other of which he believed that he had now learnedp acquiredp could still combat if he could only find out what the mistake had beenp because he did not give upp he never did give upp grandfather said that his subsequent actions pthe fact that for a time he did nothing and so perhaps helped to bring about the very situation which he dreadedp were not the result of any failing of courage or shrewdness or ruthlessnessp but were the result of his conviction that it had all come from a mistake and until he discovered what that mistake had been he did not intend to risk making another onep pso he invited bon into the housep and for the two weeks of the vacation ponly it didnpt take that longp father said that probably mrs sutpen had judith and bon already engaged from the moment she saw bonps name in henryps first letterp he watched bon and henry and judithp or watched bon and judith rather because he would have already known about henry and bon from henryps letters about him from the schoolp watched them for two weeksp and did nothingp then henry and bon went back to school and now the nigger groom that fetched the mail back and forth each week between oxford and sutpenps hundred brought letters to judith now that were not in henryps hand pand that not necessary eitherp father saidp because mrs sutpen was already covering the town and county both with news of that engagement that father said didnpt exist yetp and still he did nothingp he didnpt do anything at all until spring was almost over and henry wrote that he was bringing bon home with him to stay a day or two before bon went homep then sutpen went to new orleansp whether he chose that time to go in order to get bon and his mother together and thrash the business out for good and all or notp nobody knowsp just as nobody knows whether he ever saw the mother or not while he was therep if she received him or refused to receive himp or if she did and he tried once more to come to terms with herp buy her off maybe with money nowp since father said that a man who could believe that a scorned and outraged and angry woman could be bought off with formal logic would believe that she could be placated with money toop and it didnpt workp or if bon was there and it was bon himself who refused the offerp though nobody ever did know if bon ever knew sutpen was his father or notp whether he was trying to revenge his mother or not at first and only later fell in lovep only later succumbed to the current of retribution and fatality which miss rosa said sutpen had started and had doomed all his blood top black and white bothp but it didnpt work evidentlyp and the next christmas came and henry and bon came to sutpenps hundred again and now sutpen saw that there was no help for itp that judith was in love with bon and whether bon wanted revenge or was just caught and sunk and doomed toop it was all the samep so it seems that he sent for henry that christmas eve just before supper time pfather said that maybe by nowp after his new orleans tripp he had learned at last enough about women to know it wouldnpt do any good to go to judith firstp and told henryp and he knew what henry would say and henry said it and he took the lie from his son and henry knew by his father taking the lie that what his father had told him was truep and father said that he psutpenp probably knew what henry would do too and counted on henry doing it because he still believed that it had been only a minor tactical mistakep and so he was like a skirmisher who is outnumbered yet cannot retreat who believes that if he is just patient enough and clever enough and calm enough and alert enough he can get the enemy scattered and pick them off one by onep and henry did itp and he psutpenp probably knew what henry would do next toop that henry too would go to new orleans to find out for himselfp then it was p61 and sutpen knew what they would do nowp not only what henry would do but what he would force bon to dop maybe pbeing a demon p though it would not require a demon to foresee war nowp he even foresaw that henry and bon would join that student company at the universityp he may have had some way of watchingp knowing the day their names appeared on the rosterp some way of knowing where the company was even before grandfather became colonel of the regiment the company was in until he got hurt at pittsburg landing pwhere bon was woundedp and came home to get used to not having any right arm and sutpen came home in p64 with the two tombstones and talked to grandfather in the office that day before both of them went back to the warp p knew all the time where henry and bon werep that they had been all the time in grandfatherps regiment where grandfather could look after them in a fashion even if grandfather didnpt know that he was doing it p even if they needed watchingp because sutpen must have known about the probation toop what henry was doing nowp holding all three of them p himself and judith and bon p in that suspension while he wrestled with his conscience to make it come to terms with what he wanted to do just like his father had that time more than thirty years agop maybe even turned fatalist like bon now and giving the war a chance to settle the whole business by killing him or bon or both of them pbut with no helpp no fudgingp on his part because it was him that carried bon to the rear after pittsburg landingp or maybe he knew that the south would be whipped and then there wouldnpt be anything left that mattered that muchp worth getting that heated overp worth protesting against or suffering for or dying for or even living forp that was the day he came to the officep his p  p p ppthe demonpspp shreve saidp p p  p one day of leave at homep came home with his tombstones and judith was there and i reckon he looked at her and she looked at him and he saidp pyou know where he isp and judith didnpt lie to himp and phe knew henryp he saidp pbut you have not heard from him yetp and judith didnpt lie about that either and she didnpt cry either because both of them knew what would be in the letter when it came so he didnpt have to askp pwhen he writes you that he is comingp you and clytie will start making the wedding dressp even if judith would have lied to him about thatp which she would not havep so he put one of the stones on ellenps grave and set the other one up in the hall and came in to see grandfatherp trying to explain itp seeing if grandfather could discover that mistake which he believed was the sole cause of his problemp sitting there in his worn and shabby uniformp with his worn gauntlets and faded sash and phe would have had the plume by all meansp he might have had to discard his sabrep but he would have had the plumep the plume in his hat broken and frayed and soiledp with his horse saddled and waiting in the street below and a thousand miles to ride to find his regimentp yet he sitting there on the one afternoon of his leave as though he had a thousand of themp as if there were no haste nor urgency anywhere under the sun and that when he departed he had no further to go than the twelve miles out to sutpenps hundred and a thousand days or maybe even years of monotony and rich peacep and hep even after he would become deadp still therep still watching the fine grandsons and greatpgrandsons springing as far as eye could reachp he stillp even though dead in the earthp that same fine figure of a man that wash jones called himp but not nowp now fogbound by his own private embattlement of personal moralityp that picayune splitting of abstract hairs while pgrandfather saidp rome vanished and jericho crumbledp that this would be right if or that would be wrong but of slowing blood and stiffening bones and arteries that father says men resort to in senility who while young and supple and strong reacted to a single simple yes and a single simple no as instantaneous and complete and unthinking as the snapping on and off of electricityp sitting there and talking and now grandfather not knowing what he was talking about because now grandfather said he did not believe that sutpen himself knew because even yet sutpen had not quite told him all of itp and this that morality againp grandfather saidp that morality which would not permit him to malign or traduce the memory of his first wifep or at least the memory of the marriage even though he felt that he had been tricked by itp not even to an acquaintance in whose confidence and discretion he trusted enough to wish to justify himselfp not even to his son by another marriage in order to preserve the status of his lifeps attainment and desirep except as a last resortp not that he would hesitate thenp grandfather saidp but not until thenp he had been tricked by it himselfp but he had extricated himself without asking or receiving help from any manp let anyone else who might be so imposed upon do the samep p sitting there and moralising on the fact thatp no matter which course he chosep the result would be that that design and plan to which he had given fifty years of his life had just as well never have existed at all by almost exactly fifty yearsp and grandfather not knowing what choice he was talking about evenp what second choice he was faced with until the very last word he spoke before he got up and put on his hat and shook grandfatherps left hand and rode awayp this second choicep need to choosep as obscure to grandfather as the reason for the firstp the repudiationp had beenp so that grandfather did not even say pi dont know which you should choosep not because that was all he could have said and so to say that would be less than no answer at allp but that anything he might have said would have been less than no answer at all since sutpen was not listeningp did not expect an answerp who had not come for pity and there was no advice that he could have takenp and justification he had already coerced from his conscience thirty years agop and he still knew that he had couragep and though he may have come to doubt lately that he had acquired that shrewdness which at one time he believed he hadp he still believed that it existed somewhere in the world to be learned and that if it could be learned he would yet learn it p and maybe even thisp grandfather saidp if shrewdness could not extricate him this second time as it had beforep he could at least depend on the courage to find him will and strength to make a third start toward that design as it had found him to make the second with p who came into the office not for pity and not for help because grandfather said he had never learned how to ask anybody for help or anything else and so he would not have known what to do with the help if grandfather could have given it to himp but came just with that sober and quiet bemusementp hoping maybe pif he hoped at allp if he were doing anything but just thinking out loud at allp that the legal mind might perceive and clarify that initial mistake which he still insisted onp which he himself had not been able to findp pi was faced with condoning a fact which had been foisted upon me without my knowledge during the process of building toward my designp which meant the absolute and irrevocable negation of the designp or in holding to my original plan for the design in pursuit of which i had incurred this negationp i chosep and i made to the fullest what atonement lay in my power for whatever injury i might have done in choosingp paying even more for the privilege of choosing as i chose than i might have been expected top or even pby lawp requiredp yet i am now faced with a second necessity to choosep the curious factor of which is notp as you pointed out and as first appeared to mep that the necessity for a new choice should have arisenp but that either choice which i might makep either course which i might choosep leads to the same resultp either i destroy my design with my own handp which will happen if i am forced to play my last trump cardp or do nothingp let matters take the course which i know they will take and see my design complete itself quite normally and naturally and successfully to the public eyep yet to my own in such fashion as to be a mockery and a betrayal of that little boy who approached that door fifty years ago and was turned awayp for whose vindication the whole plan was conceived and carried forward to the moment of this choicep this second choice devolving out of that first one which in its turn was forced on me as the result of an agreementp an arrangement which i had entered in good faithp concealing nothingp while the other party or parties to it concealed from me the one very factor which would destroy the entire plan and design which i had been working towardp concealed it so well that it was not until after the child was born that i discovered that this factor existedp p  p p pyour old manpp shreve saidp pwhen your grandfather was telling this to himp he didnpt know any more what your grandfather was talking about than your grandfather knew what the demon was talking about when the demon told it to himp did hep and when your old man told it to youp

his face still loweredp still brooding apparently on the open letter upon the open book between his handsp phe left for virginia that nightp grandfather said how he went to the window and watched him ride across the square on the gaunt black stallionp erect in his faded grayp the hat with its broken plume cocked a little yet not quite so much as the beaver of the old daysp as if pgrandfather saidp even with his martial rank and prerogatives he did not quite swagger like he used to dop not because he was chastened by misfortune or spent or even warpwearied but as though even while riding he was still bemused in that state in which he struggled to hold clear and free above a maelstrom of unpredictable and unreasoning human beingsp not his head for breath and not so much his fifty years of effort and striving to establish a posterityp but his code of logic and moralityp his formula and recipe of fact and deduction whose balanced sum and product declinedp refused to swim or even floatp p saw him approach the holston house and saw old mr mccaslin and two other old men hobble out and stop himp he sitting the stallion and talking to them and his voice not raisedp grandfather saidp yet the very sober quality of his gestures and the set of his shoulders forensicp oratoricalp then he went onp he could still reach sutpenps hundred before darkp so it was probably after supper that he headed the stallion toward the atlantic oceanp he and judith facing one another again for maybe a full minutep he not needing to say pi will stop it if i canpp she not needing to say pstop it then p

for more reason than because he just had one armp had retreated across georgia and into carolina and they all knew it wouldnpt be very much longer nowp then one day lee sent johnston some reinforcements from one of his corps and grandfather found out that the twentypthird mississippi was one of the regimentsp and he pgrandfatherp didnpt know what had happenedp whether sutpen had found out in some way that henry had at last coerced his conscience into agreeing with him as his phenrypsp father had done thirty years agop whether judith perhaps had written her father that she had heard from bon at last and what she and bon intended to dop or if the four of them had just reached as one person that point where something had to be donep had to happenp he pgrandfatherp didnpt knowp he just learned one morning that sutpen had ridden up to grandfatherps old regimentps headquarters and asked and received permission to speak to henry and did speak to him and then rode away again before midnightpp pso he got his choice made after allpp shreve saidp phe played that trump after allp and so he came home and found p  p p pwaitpp quentin saidp p p  p what he must have wanted to find or

word nor warning even if judith would have sent him onep sent him acknowledgement that she was beatenp who according to mr compson would no more have sent him acknowledgement that he had beat her than she waited pwho miss coldfield said was not bereavedp and met him on his returnp not with the fury and despair perhaps which he might have expected even though knowing as littlep having learned as

hurryp he was not concernedp mr compson saidp about the courage and the willp nor even about the shrewdness nowp he was not for one moment concerned about his ability to start the third timep all that he was concerned about was the possibility that he might not have time sufficient to do it inp regain his lost ground inp he did not waste any of what time he had eitherp the will and the shrewdness too he did not wastep though he doubtless did not consider it to have been either his will or his shrewdness which supplied waiting to his hand the opportunityp and it was probably less of shrewdness and more of courage than even will which got him engaged to miss rosa within a period of three months and almost before she was aware of the fact p miss rosap the chief disciple and advocate of that cult of demonpharrying of which he was the chief object peven though not victimpp engaged to him before she had got accustomed to having him in the housep p yesp more of courage than even willp yet something of shrewdness toop the shrewdness acquired in excruciating driblets through the fifty years suddenly capitulant and retroactive or suddenly sprouting and flowering like a seed lain fallow in a vacuum or in a single iron clodp because he seemed to perceive without stoppingp in that passage through the house which was an unbroken continuation of the long journey from virginiap the pause not to greet his family but merely to pick up jones and drag him on out to the brierpchoked fields and fallen fences and clap axe or mattock into his handsp the one weak spotp the one spot vulnerable to assault in miss rosaps embattled spinsterhoodp and to assault and carry this in one stridep with something of the ruthless tactical skill of his old master pthe twentypthird mississippi was in jacksonps corps at one timepp and then the shrewdness failed him againp it broke downp it vanished into that old impotent logic and morality which had betrayed him beforep and what day might it have beenp what furrow might he have stopped dead inp one foot advancedp the unsentient plow handles in his instantaneous unsentient handsp what fence panel held in midair as though it had no weight by

and that possibly he could get but one more sonp had at best but one more son in his loinsp as the old cannon might know when it has just one more shot in its corporealityp so he suggested what he

time there might not be enough powder for both a spotting shot and then a fullpsized loadp p the fact that the thread of shrewdness and courage and will ran onto the same spool which the thread of his remaining days ran onto and that spool almost near enough for him to reach out his hand and touch itp but this was no grave concern yetp since it pthe old logicp the old morality which had never yet failed to fail himp was already falling into patternp already showing him conclusively that he had been rightp just as he knew he had beenp and therefore what had happened was just a delusion and did

even falterp taking shreve up in stride without comma or colon or paragraphp p p no reserve to risk a spotting shot with now so he started this one like you start a rabbit out of a brier patchp with a little chunk of dried mud thrown by handp maybe it was the first string of beads out of his and washps little store where he would get mad at his customersp the niggers and the trash and the hagglingp and turn them out and lock the door and drink himself blindp and maybe wash delivered the beads himselfp father saidp that was down at the gate when he rode back from the war that dayp that after he went away with the regiment would tell folks that he pwashp was looking after kernelps place and niggers until after a while maybe he even believed itp fatherps mother said how when the sutpen niggers first heard about what he was sayingp they would stop him in the road that came up out of the bottom where the old fishing camp was that sutpen let him and the granddaughter pshe was about eight thenp live inp there would be too many of them for him to whip them allp to even try top risk trying top and they would ask him why he wasnpt at the war and he would sayp pgit outen my roadp niggerspp and then it would be the outright laughingp asking one another pexcept it was not one another but himpp pwho himp calling us niggerspp and he would rush at them with a stick and them avoiding him just enoughp not mad at allp just laughingp and he was still carrying fish and animals he killed por maybe stolep and vegetables up to the house when that was about all mrs sutpen and judith pand clytie toop had to live onp and clytie would not let him come into the kitchen with the basket evenp sayingp pstop right therep white manp stop right where you isp you aint never crossed this door while colonel was here and you aint going to cross it nowpp which was truep only father said there was a kind of pride in itp that he had never tried to enter the housep even though he believed that if he had triedp sutpen would not have let them repulse himp like pfather saidp he might have said to himself the reason i wont try it aint that i refuse to give any black nigger the chance to tell me i cant but because i aint going to force mister tom to have to cuss a nigger or take a cussing from his wife on my account but they would drink together under the scuppernong arbor on the sunday afternoonsp and on the week days he would see sutpen pthe fine figure of the man as he called itp on the black stallionp galloping about the plantationp and father said how for that moment washps heart would be quiet and proud both and that maybe it would seem to him that this world where niggersp that the bible said had been created and cursed by god to be brute and vassal to all men of white skinp were better found and housed and even clothed than he and his granddaughter p that this world where he walked always in mocking and jeering echoes of nigger laughterp was just a dream and an illusion and that the actual world was the one where his own lonely apotheosis pfather saidp galloped on the black thoroughbredp thinking maybep father saidp how the book said that all men were created in the image of god and so all men were the same in godps eyes anywayp looked the same to god at leastp and so he would look at sutpen and think a fine proud manp if god himself was to come down and ride the natural earthp thatps what he would aim to look likep maybe he even delivered the first string of beads himselfp and father said maybe each of the ribbons afterward during the next three years while the girl matured fast like girls of that kind dop or anyway he would know and recognise each and every ribbon when he saw it on her even when she lied to him about where and how she got itp which she probably did notp since she would be bound to know that he had been seeing the ribbons in the showcase every day for three years and would have known them as well as he knew his own shoesp and not only he knew themp but all the other menp the customers and the loungersp the white and the black that would be sitting and squatting about the storeps gallery to watch her passp not quite defiant and not quite cringing and not quite flaunting the ribbons and the beadsp but almostp not quite any of them but a little of allp bold sullen and fearfulp but father said how washps heart was probably still quiet even after he saw the dress and spoke about itp probably only a little grave now and watching her secret defiant frightened face while she told him pbefore he had askedp maybe too insistentp too quick to volunteer itp that miss judith had given it to herp helped her to make itp and father said maybe he realised all of a sudden and without warning that when he passed the men on the gallery they would look after him too and that they already knew that which he had just thought they were probably thinkingp but father said his heart was still quietp even nowp and that he answeredp if he answered at allp stopped the protestations and disclaimers at allp pshop nowp ef kernel and miss judith wanted to give hit to youp i hope you minded to thank thempp p not alarmedp father saidp just thoughtfulp just gravep and father said how that afternoon grandfather rode out to see sutpen about something and there was nobody in the front of the store and he was about to go out and go up to the house when he heard the voices from the back and he walked on toward them and so he overheard them before he could begin to not listen and before he could make them hear him calling sutpenps namep grandfather couldnpt see them yetp he hadnpt even got to where they could hear him yetp but he said he knew exactly how they would bep sutpen having already told wash to get the jug out and then wash spoke and sutpen beginning to turnp realising that wash wasnpt getting the jug before he comprehended the import of what wash was sayingp then comprehending that and still half turned and then all of a sudden kind of reared back and flinging his head upp looking at wash and wash standing therep not cringing eitherp in that attitude dogged and quiet and not cringingp and sutpen saidp pwhat about the dresspp and grandfather said it was sutpenps voice that was short and sharpp not washpsp that washps voice was just flat and quietp not abjectp just patient and slowp pi have knowed you for going on twenty years nowp i aint never denied yit to do what you told me to dop and ipm a man past sixtyp and she aint nothing but a fifteenpyearpold galpp and sutpen saidp pmeaning that ipd harm the girlp ip a man as old as you arepp and washp pif you was arra other manp ipd say you was as old as mep and old or no oldp i wouldnpt let her keep that dress nor nothing else that come from your handp but you are differentpp and sutpenp phow differentpp and grandfather said how wash did not answer and that he called again now and neither of them heard himp and then sutpen saidp pso thatps why you are afraid of mepp and wash saidp pi aint afraidp because you are bravep it aint that you were a brave man at one second or minute or hour of your life and got a paper to show hit from general leep but you are bravep the same as you are alive and breathingp thatps where itps differentp hit dont need no ticket from nobody to tell me thatp and i know that whatever your hands techp whether hitps a regiment of men or a ignorant gal or just a hound dogp that you will make hit rightpp then grandfather heard sutpen movep sudden and sharpp and grandfather said he reckonedp thought just about what he imagined wash was thinkingp but all sutpen said wasp pget the jugpp p pshop kernelpp wash saidp pso that sunday camep a year after that day and three years after he had suggested to miss rosa that they try it first and if it was a boy and livedp they would be marriedp it was before daylight and he was expecting his mare to foal to the black stallionp so when he left the house before day that morning judith thought he was going to the stablep who knew what and how much about her father and washps granddaughter nobody knewp how much she could not have helped but know from what clytie must have known pmay have or may not have told herp whether or nop since everybody else white or black in the neighborhood knew who had ever seen the girl pass in the ribbons and beads which they all recognisedp how much she may have refused to discover during the fitting and sewing of that dress pfather said judith actually did thisp this was no lie that the girl told washp the two of them alone all day long for about a week in the housep and what they must have talked aboutp what judith must have talked about while the girl stood around in what she possessed to call under clothesp with her sullen defiant secret watchful facep answering whatp telling what that judith may or may not have tried to shut her eyes top nobody knewpp so it was not until he failed to return at dinner time that she went or sent clytie to the stable and found that the mare had foaled in the night but that her father was not therep and it was not until midafternoon that she found a halfgrown boy and paid him a nickel to go down to the old fish camp and ask wash where sutpen wasp and the boy walked whistling around the corner of the rotting cabin and saw maybe the scythe firstp maybe the body first lying in the weeds which wash had not yet cutp and as he screamed he looked up and saw wash in the windowp watching himp then about a week later they caught the niggerp the midwifep and she told how she didnpt know that wash was there at all that dawn when she heard the horse and then sutpenps feet and he came in and stood over the pallet where the girl and the baby were and saidp ppenelope p ppthat was the marepp p foaled this morningp a damned fine coltp going to be the spit and image of his daddy when i rode him north in p61p do you rememberpp and the old nigger said she saidp pyesp marsterp and that he jerked the riding whip toward the pallet and saidp pwellp damn your black hidep horse or marepp and that she told him and that he stood there for a minute and he didnpt move at allp with the riding whip against his leg and the lattices of sunlight from the unchinked wall falling upon himp across his white hair and his beard that hadnpt turned at all yetp and she said she saw his eyes and then his teeth inside his beard and that she would have run then only she couldnptp couldnpt seem to make her legs bear to get up and runp and then he looked at the girl on the pallet again and saidp pwellp millyp too bad youpre not a mare toop then i could give you a decent stall in the stablep and turned and went outp only she could not move even yetp and she didnpt even know that wash was outside therep she just heard sutpen sayp pstand backp washp dont you touch mepp and then washp his voice soft and hardly loud enough to reach herp pipm going to tech youp kernelpp and sutpen againp pstand backp washpp sharp nowp and then she heard the whip on washps face but she didnpt know if she heard the scythe or not because now she found out that she could movep get upp run out of the cabin and into the weedsp running p  p p pwaitpp shreve saidp pwaitp you mean that he had got the son at last that he wantedp yet still he p  p p p p walked the three miles and back before midnight to fetch the old niggerp then sat on the sagging gallery until daylight came and the granddaughter stopped screaming inside the cabin and he even heard the baby oncep waiting for sutpenp and father said his heart was quiet then toop even though he knew what they would be saying in every cabin about the land by nightfallp just as he had known what they were saying during the last four or five months while his granddaughterps condition pwhich he had never tried to concealp could no longer be mistakenp wash jones has fixed old sutpen at lastp it taken him twenty years to do itp but he has got a holt of old sutpen at last where sutpen will either have to tear meat or squeal thatps what father said he was thinking while he waited outside on the gallery where the old nigger had sent himp ordered him outp standing there maybe by the very post where the scythe had leaned rusting for two yearsp while the granddaughterps screams came steady as a clock now but his own heart quietp not at all concerned nor alarmedp and father said that maybe while he stood befogged in his fumbling and groping pthat morality of his that was a good deal like sutpenpsp that told him he was right in the face of all fact and usage and everything elsep which had always been somehow mixed up and involved with galloping hooves even during the old peace that nobody rememberedp and in which during the four years of the war which he had not attended the galloping had been only the more gallant and proud and thunderousp p father said that maybe he got his answerp that maybe there broke free and plain in midgallop against the yellow sky of dawn the fine proud image of the man on the fine proud image of the stallion and that the fumbling and the groping broke clear and free toop not in justification or explanation or extenuation or excusep father saidp but as the apotheosis lonelyp explicablep beyond all human foulingp he is bigger than all them yankees that killed us and ournp that killed his wife and widowed his daughter and druv his son from homep that stole his niggers and ruined his landp bigger than this whole county that he fit for and in payment for which has brung him to keeping a little country store for his bread and meatp bigger than the scorn and denial which hit helt to his lips like the bitter cup in the bookp and how could i have lived nigh to him for twenty years without being touched and changed by himp maybe i am not as big as he is and maybe i did not do any of the gallopingp but at least i was drug along where he wentp and me and him can still do hit and will ever sop if so be he will show me what he aims for me to dop and maybe still standing there and holding the stallionps reins after sutpen had entered the cabinp still hearing the gallopingp watching the proud galloping image merge and passp galloping through avatars which marked the accumulation of yearsp timep to the fine climax where it galloped without weariness or progressp forever and forever immortal beneath the brandished sabre and the shotptorn flags rushing down a sky in color like thunderp stood there and heard sutpen inside the house speak his single sentence of salutation inquiry and farewell to the granddaughterp and father said that for a second wash must not have felt the very earth under his feet while he watched sutpen emerge from the housep the riding whip in his handp thinking quietlyp like in a dreamp i kaint have heard what i know i heardp i just know i kaint thinking that was what got him upp it was that coltp it aint me or mine eitherp it wasnpt even his own that got him out of bed maybe feeling no earthp no stabilityp even yetp maybe not even hearing his own voice when sutpen saw his face pthe face of the man who in twenty years he had no more known to make any move save at command than he had the stallion which he rodep and stoppedp pyou said if she was a mare you could give her a decent stall in the stablepp maybe not even hearing sutpen when he saidp sudden and sharpp pstand backp dont you touch mep only he must have heard that because he answered itp pipm going to tech youp kernelp and sutpen said pstand backp washp again before the old woman heard the whipp only there were two blows with the whipp they found the two welts on washps face that nightp maybe the two blows even knocked him downp maybe it was while he was getting up that he put his hand on the scythe p  p p pwaitpp shreve saidp pfor christps sake waitp you mean that he p  p p p p sat there all that day in the little window where he could watch the roadp probably laid the scythe down and went straight into the house where maybe the granddaughter on the pallet asked querulously what it was and he answeredp pwhutp whut racketp honeypp and maybe he tried to persuade her to eat too p the side meat he had probably brought home from the store saturday night or maybe the candyp trying to tempt her with it maybe p the nickelps worth of stale jellified glue out of a striped sackp and maybe ate himself and then sat at the window where he could look out above the body and the scythe in the weeds belowp and watch the roadp because he was sitting there when the half grown boy came around the corner of the house whistling and saw himp and father said he must have realised then that it would not be much after dark when it would happenp that he must have sat there and sensedp felt them gathering with the horses and dogs and guns p the curious and the vengeful p men of sutpenps own kindp who used to eat at his table with him back when he pwashp had yet to approach nearer the house than the scuppernong arbor p men who had led the wayp shown the other and lesser ones how to fight in battlesp who might also possess signed papers from the generals saying that they were among the first and foremost of the brave p who had galloped also in the old days arrogant and proud on the fine horses about the fine plantations p symbol also of admiration and hopep instruments too of despair and griefp these it was whom he was expected to run from and it seeming to him probably that he had no less to run from than he had to run top that if he ran he would be fleeing merely one set of bragging and evil shadows for anotherp since they pmenp were all of a kind throughout all of earth which he knewp and he oldp too old to run far even if he were to run who could never escape themp no matter how much or how far he ranp a man past sixty could not expect to run that farp far enough to escape beyond the boundaries of earth where such men livedp set the order and the rule of livingp and father said that maybe for the first time in his life he began to comprehend how it had been possible for yankees or any other army to have whipped them p the gallantp the proudp the bravep the acknowledged and chosen best among them all to bear the courage and honor and pridep it would probably be about sunset now and probably he could feel them quite near nowp father said it probably seemed to him that he could even hear themp all the voicesp the murmuring of tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow beyond the immediate furyp old wash jones come a tumble at lastp he thought he had sutpenp but sutpen fooled himp he thought he had himp but old wash jones got fooled and then maybe even saying it aloudp shouting it father saidp pbut i never expected thatp kernelp you know i neverpp until maybe the granddaughter stirred and spoke querulously again and he went and quieted her and returned to talk to himself again but careful nowp quiet now since sutpen was close enough to hear him easyp without shoutingp pyou know i neverp you know i never expected or asked or wanted nothing from arra living man but what i expected from youp and i never asked thatp i didnpt think hit would needp i just said to myself i dont need top what need has a fellow like wash jones to question or doubt the man that general lee himself said in a handpwrote ticket that he was bravep bravep pand maybe it would be loud againp forgetting againp pbravep better if narra one of them had ever rid back in p65p thinking better if his kind and mine too had never drawn the breath of life on this earthp better that all who remain of us be blasted from the face of it than that another wash jones should see his whole life shredded from him and shrivel away like a dried shuck thrown onto the fire then they rode upp he must have been listening to them as they came down the roadp the dogs and the horsesp and seen the lanterns since it was dark nowp and major de spain who was sheriff then got down and saw the bodyp though he said he did not see wash nor know that he was there until wash spoke his name quietly from the window almost in his facep pthat youp majorpp de spain told him to come on out and he said how washps voice was quite quiet when he said he would be out in just a minutep it was too quietp too calmp so much too quiet and calm that de spain said he did not realise for a moment that it was too calm and quietp pin just a minutep soon as i see about my granddaughterpp pwepll see to herpp de spain saidp pyou come on outpp pshop majorpp wash saidp pin just a minutepp so they waited in front of the dark housep and the next day father said there were a hundred that remembered about the butcher knife that he kept hidden and razorpsharp p the one thing in his sloven life that he was ever known to take pride in or care of p only by the time they remembered all this it was too latep so they didnpt know what he was aboutp they just heard him moving inside the dark housep then they heard the granddaughterps voicep fretful and querulousp pwho is itp light the lampp grandpawp then his voicep phit wont need no lightp honeyp hit wont take but a minutep then de spain drew his pistol and saidp pyoup washp come out of therepp and still wash didnpt answerp murmuring still to the granddaughterp pwhere air youpp and the fretful voice answeringp pright herep where else would i bep what is p  p p then de spain saidp pjonespp and he was already fumbling at the broken steps when the granddaughter screamedp and now all the men there claimed that they heard the knife on both the neckbonesp though de spain didnptp he just said he knew that wash had come out onto the gallery and that he sprang back before he found out that it was not toward him wash was running but toward the end of the galleryp where the body layp but that he did not think about the scythep he just ran backward a few feet when he saw wash stoop and rise again and now wash was running toward himp only he was running toward them allp de spain saidp running into the lanterns so that now they could see the scythe raised above his headp they could see his facep his eyes toop as he ran with the scythe above his headp straight into the lanterns and the gun barrelsp making no soundp no outcry while de spain ran backward before himp sayingp pjonesp stopp stopp or ipll kill youp jonesp jonesp jonespp p pwaitpp shreve saidp pyou mean that he got the son he wantedp after all that troublep and then turned right around and p  p p pyesp sitting in grandfatherps office that afternoonp with his head kind of flung back a littlep explaining to grandfather like he might have been explaining arithmetic to henry back in the fourth gradep pyou seep all i wanted was just a sonp which seems to mep when i look about at my contemporary scenep no exorbitant gift from nature or circumstance to demand p  p p p pwill you waitpp shreve saidp p p that with the son he went to all that trouble to get lying right there behind him in the cabinp he would have to taunt the grandfather into killing first him and then the child toopp p p whatpp quentin saidp pit wasnpt a sonp it was a girlpp pohpp shreve saidp p p  p come onp letps get out of this damn icebox and go to bedpp there would be no deep breathing tonightp the window would remain

tranquilp faint and clear as glass in the fierce pit had quit snowingp still airp pso the old man sent the nigger for henrypp shreve saidp pand henry came in and the old man said pthey cannot marry because he is your brotherp and henry said pyou liep like thatp that quickp no spacep no intervalp no nothing between like when you press the button and get light in the roomp and the old man just sat therep didnpt even move and strike him and so henry didnpt say pyou liep again because he knew now it was sop he just said pitps not truepp not pi dont believe itp but pitps not truep because he could maybe see the old manps face again now and demon or no it was a kind of grief and pityp not for himself but for henryp because henry was just young while he pthe old manp knew that he still had the courage and even all the shrewdness too p  p p shreve stood beside the tablep facing quentin again though not seated nowp in the overcoat buttoned awry over the bathrobe he looked huge and shapeless

slowly on in that rhythm which not the eyes but the heart marks and calls the beat and measure forp to disappear slowly beyond some bush or shrub starred with white bloom p jasminep spiraeap honeysucklep perhaps myriad scentless unpickable cherokee roses p namesp blooms which shreve possibly had never heard and never seen although the air had blown over him first which became tempered to nourish them p and it would not matter here that the time had been winter in that garden too and hence no bloom nor leaf even if there had been someone to walk there and be seen there sincep judged by subsequent eventsp it had been night in the garden alsop but that did not matter because it had been so long agop it did not matter to them pquentin and shrevep anywayp who could without movingp as

called by so long as the blood coursed p the bloodp the immortal brief recent intransient blood which could hold honor above slothy unregret and love above fat and easy shamep pand bon didnpt know itpp shreve saidp pthe old man didnpt move and this time henry didnpt say pyou liepp he said pitps not truep and the old man saidp pask himp ask charles thenp and then henry knew that that was what his father had meant all the time and that that was what he meant himself when he told his father he liedp because what the old man said wasnpt just phe is your brotherp but phe has known all the time that he is yours and your sisterps brotherpp but bon didnptp listenp dont you remember how your father said itp about how not one time did he p the old guyp the demon p ever seem to wonder either how

only that she had done itp had tracked him downp could have and would have wanted top so it wasnpt her that told bonp she wouldnpt havep maybe for the reason that she knew he p the demon p would believe she hadp or maybe she didnpt get around to telling himp maybe she just never thought that there could be anyone as close to her as a lone child out of her own body who would have to be told how she had been scorned and sufferedp or maybe she was already telling it before he was big enough to know words and so by the time he was big enough to understand what was being told him she had told it so much and so hard that the words didnpt make sense to her anymore either because they didnpt have to make sense to herp and so she had got to the point where when she thought she was saying it she was quietp and when she thought she was quiet it was just the hate and the fury and the unsleeping and the unforgettingp or maybe she didnpt intend for him to know it thenp maybe she was grooming him for that hour and moment which she couldnpt foresee but that she knew would arrive some day because it would have to arrive or else she would have to do like the aunt rosa and deny that she had ever breathed p the moment when he would stand side by side pnot face to facep with his father where fate or luck or justice or whatever she called it could do the rest pand it didp better than she could have invented or hoped or even dreamedp and your father said how being a woman she probably wasnpt even surprisedp p grooming him herselfp bringing him on by hand herselfp washing and

day or so from whatever harmless pursuit in which you were not bothering anybody or even thinking about themp by someone because that someone was bigger than youp stronger than youp and being held for a minute or five minutes under a kind of busted water pipe of incomprehensible fury and fierce yearning and vindictiveness and jealous rage was a part of childhood which all mothers of children had received in turn from their mothers and from their mothers in turn from that porto rico or haiti or wherever it was we all came from but none of us ever lived inp so that when he grew up and had children he would have to pass it on too pand maybe deciding then and there that it was too much trouble and bother and that he would not have any children or at least hoped he would notp and hence no man had a fatherp no one personal porto rico or haitip but all mother faces which ever bred swooping down at those almost calculable moments out of some obscure ancient general affronting and

brothered perennial and ubiquitous everywhere under the sun p  p p they stared at one another p glared rather p their quiet regular breathing vaporising faintly and steadily in the now tomblike airp there was something curious in the way they looked at one anotherp curious and quiet and profoundly intentp not at all as two young men might look at each other but almost as a youth and a very young girl might out of virginity itself p a sort of hushed and naked searchingp each look burdened with youthps immemorial obsession not with timeps dragging weight which the old live with but with its fluidityp the bright heels of all the lost moments of fifteen and sixteenp pthen he got older and got out from under the apron despite her phim too maybep maybe the both of themp and he didnpt even

probably by that time he had learned that there were three things and no morep breathingp pleasurep darknessp and without money there could be no pleasurep and without pleasure it would not even be breathing but mere protoplasmic inhale and collapse of blind unorganism in a darkness where light never beganp and he had the money because he knew that she knew that the money was the only thing she

give me the jack as i want it and i wont ask why or what for yetpp or maybe she was so busy grooming him that she never thought of the money nowp who probably never had had much time to remember it or count it or wonder how much there was in the intervals of the hating and the being madp and so all to check him up about the money would be the lawyer and he pbonp probably learned that the first

because it would be the most unfortunate thing for all concerned that could occurp and though you could no more have proved vice or virtue or courage or cowardice to him without showing him the moving

plenty of good strong hating you dont need hope because the hating will be enough to nourish youpp p the old sabine pnot so old yetp but she would have just let herself go in the sense that you keep the engines clean and oiled and the best of coal in the bunkers but you dont bother to shine the brightwork or holystone the decks anymorep just let herself go on the outsidep not fatp she would burn it up too fast for thatp shrivel it away in the gullet between swallowing and stomachp no pleasure in the chewingp having to chew just another nuisance like no pleasure in the clothingp having the old

his shoulders nor in the fact that he had more watches and cuff buttons and finer linen and horses and yellowpwheeled buggies pnot to mention the galsp than most others didp but all that too just an unavoidable nuisance that he would have to get shut of before he could do her any good just like he had to get shut of the teething and the chicken pox and the light boyps bones in order to be able to do her any goodp p the old sabine getting the faked reports from the lawyer like reports sent back to headquarters from a battle frontp with maybe a special nigger in the lawyerps anteroom to do nothing else but carry them and that maybe once in two years or five times in two daysp depending on when she would begin to itch for news and began to worry him p the reportp the communique about how

i know he is dead and how can hep how can he bepp not meaning what the aunt rosa meantp where did they find or invent a bullet that could kill him but how can he be allowed to die without having to

big enough to find out that it wasnpt him at all she was washing and feeding the candy and the fun to but it was a man that hadnpt even arrived yetp whom even she had never seen yetp who would be something else beside that boy when he did arrive like the dynamite which destroys the house and the family and maybe even the whole community aint the old peaceful paper that maybe would rather be

tenppower spectacles came and dug them up and strained warped and kneaded themp p created between this woman and a hired lawyer pthe woman who since before he could remember he now realised had been planning and grooming him for some moment that would come and pass and following which he saw that to her he would be little more than so much rich rotting dirtp the lawyer who since before he could remember he now realised had been plowing and planting and watering and manuring and harvesting him as if he already waspp p him watching herp lounging there against the mantel maybe in the fine clothesp in the harem incense odor of what you might call easy sanctityp watching her looking at the letterp not even thinking i am looking upon my mother naked since if the hating was nakednessp she had worn it long enough now for it to do the office of clothing like they say that modesty can dop does p  p  pso he went awayp he went away to school at the age of twentypeightp and he wouldnpt know nor care about that eitherp which of them p mother or lawyer p it was who decided he should go to school nor whyp because he had known all the time that his mother was up to something and that the lawyer was up to somethingp and he didnpt care enough about what either of them was to try to find outp who knew that the lawyer knew that his mother was up to something but that his mother didnpt know that the lawyer was up to somethingp and that it would be all right with the lawyer if his mother got whatever it was she wantedp provided he pthe lawyerp got what he wanted one second before or at least at the same timep he went away to schoolp he said pall rightp and told the octoroon goodbye and went to schoolp who not in all the twentypeight years had ever been told by anyonep pdo as these others dop have this task done at nine abbreviationremoved tomorrow or friday or mondaypp maybe it was even the octoroon whom they por the lawyerp used p the light block pnot tetherp which the lawyer had put on him to keep him from getting inside of something which might be found to have a fence around it laterp maybe the mother found out about the octoroon and the child and the ceremony and discovered more than the lawyer had por would believep who considered bon only dullp not a foolp and sent for him and he came and lounged against the mantel again and maybe knowing what was upp what had happened before she told himp lounging there with an expression on his face you might call smiling except it was not that but just something you couldnpt see through or pastp and she watching him with maybe the lank ironpcolored strand of hair down again and not even bothering to brush it back now because she was not looking at any letter now but her eyes blazing at himp her voice trying to blaze at him out of the urgency of alarm and fearp but she managing to keep it down since she could not talk about betrayal because she had not told him yetp and nowp at this momentp she would not dare risk itp p he looking at her from behind the smiling that wasnpt smiling but was just something you were not supposed to see beyondp sayingp admitting itp pwhy notp all young men do itp the ceremony toop i didnpt set out to get the childp but now that i havep punctellipse itps not a bad childp eitherp and she watching himp glaring at him and not being able to say what she would because she had put off too long now saying what she couldp pbut youp this is differentp and he pshe would not need to say itp he would know because he already knew why she had sent for himp even if he did not know and did not care what she had been up to since before he could rememberp since before he could take a woman whether in love or notpp pwhy notp men seem to have to marry some dayp sooner or laterp and this is one whom i knowp who makes me no troublep and with the ceremonyp that botherp already donep and as for a little matter like a spot of negro blood p  p p not needing to talk muchp say much eitherp not needing to say i seem to have been born into this world with so few fathers that i have too many brothers to outrage and shame while alive and hence too many descendants to bequeath my little portion of hurt and harm top deadp not thatp just pa little spot of negro blood p  p p and then to watch the facep the desperate urgency and fearp then to departp kissing her maybep her hand maybe which would lie in his and even touch his lips like a dead hand because of the desperate casting for this straw or thatp maybe as he went out he said she will go to him pthe lawyerpp if i were to wait five minutes i could see her in the shawlp so probably by tonight i will be able to know p if i cared to knowp maybe by night he didp maybe before that if they managed to find himp get word to himp because she went to the lawyerp and it was right in the lawyerps alleyp maybe before she even got started telling it good that gentle white glow began like when you turn up a wickp maybe he could even almost see his hand writing on into the space where the daughterp daughterp daughterp never had quite showedp because maybe that had been the lawyerps trouble and worry and concern all the timep that ever since she had made him promise he would never tell bon who his father wasp he had been waiting and wondering how to do itp since maybe he knew that if he were to tell bonp bon might believe it or he might notp but certainly he would go and tell his mother that the lawyer had told him and then he pthe lawyerp would be sunkp not for any harm done because there would be no harmp since this could not alter the situationp but for having crossed his paranoiac clientp maybe while he would sit in his office adding and subtracting the money and adding what they would get out of sutpen phe was never worried about what bon would do when he found outp he had probably a long time ago paid bon that compliment of thinking that even if he was too dull or too indolent to suspect or find out about his father himselfp he wasnpt fool enough not to be able to take advantage of it once somebody showed him the proper movep maybe if the thought had ever occurred to him that because of love or honor or anything else under heaven or jurisprudence eitherp bon would notp would refuse top he pthe lawyerp would even have furnished proof that he no longer breathedp p maybe all the time it was this that racked himp how to get bon where he would either have to find it out himselfp or where somebody p the father or the mother p would have to tell himp so maybe she wasnpt out of the office good p or at least as soon as he had had time to open the safe and look in the secret drawer and make sure that it was the university of mississippi that henry attended p before his hand was

periodp lining out the crediblep writing in certainp underlining itp pand he didnpt care about that toop he just saidp pall rightpp because maybe he knew now that his mother didnpt know and never would know what she wantedp and so he couldnpt beat her pmaybe he had learned from the octoroon that you cant beat women anyhow and that if you are wise or dislike trouble and uproar you dont even try topp and he knew that all the lawyer wanted was just the moneyp and so if he just didnpt make the mistake of believing that he could beat all of itp if he just remembered to be quiet and be alert he could beat some of itp p so he saidp pall rightp and let his mother pack the fine clothes and the fine linen into the bags and trunksp and maybe he lounged into the lawyerps office and watched from behind that something which could have been called smiling while the lawyer made the elbow motion about getting his horses onto the steamboat and maybe buying him an extra special body servant and arranging about the money and allp watching from behind the smiling while the lawyer did the heavy father evenp talking about the scholarshipp the culturep the latin and the greek that would equip and polish him for the position which he would hold in life and how a man to be sure could get that anywherep in his own library evenp who had the willp but how there was somethingp some quality to

saidp pitps about forty miles from p  p p p p poxfordpp and then the papers could be still again because he would be talkingp about a small college only ten years oldp about how there wouldnpt be anything to distract him from his studies there pwherep in a sensep wisdom herself would be a virgin or at least not very second handp and how he would have a chance to observe another and a provincial section of the country in which his high destiny pgranted the outcome of this war which was without doubt imminentp the successful conclusion of which we all hoped forp had no doubt ofp as the man he would be and the economic power he would represent when his mother passed onp was rootedp and he listening behind that expressionp sayingp pthen you dont recommend the law as a vocationpp and now for just a moment the lawyer would stopp but not longp maybe not long enough or perceptible enough for you to call it pausep and he would be looking at bon toop pit hadnpt occurred to me that the law might appeal to youp and bonp pneither did practising with a rapier appeal to me while i was doing itp but i can recall at least one occasion in my life when i was glad i hadp and then the lawyerp smooth and easyp pthen by all means let it be the lawp your mother will ag p be pleasedpp pall rightpp he saidp not pgoodbyepp he didnpt carep maybe not even goodbye to the octoroonp to those

letter itself right there under his feetp somewhere in the darkness beneath the deck on which he stood p the letter addressed not to thomas sutpen at sutpenps hundred but to henry sutpenp esquirep in residence at the university of mississippip near oxfordp mississippip and one day henry showed it to him and there was no gentle spreading glow but a flashp a glare pwho not only had no visible father

state of blessed amnesia in which the weak senses can take refuge from the godless dark forces and powers which weak human flesh cannot standp to wake pregnantp shrieking and screaming and thrashingp not against the ruthless agony of labor but in protest against the outrage of her swelling loinsp that he had been fathered on her not through that natural process but had been blotted onto and out of her body by the old infernal immortal male principle of all unbridled terror and darknessp in which he stood looking at the innocent face of the youth almost ten years his juniorp while one part of

had seen it firstp in that face where he might phe would believep have seen for himself the truth and so would have needed no signp if it hadnpt been for the beardp no sign in the eyes which could see his face because there was no beard to hide itp could have seen the truth if it were therep yet no flicker in themp and so he knew it was in his face because he knew that the other had seen it there just exactly as henry was to know the next christmas eve in the library that his father was not lying by the fact that the father said nothingp did nothingp maybe he even thoughtp wondered if perhaps that was not why the beardp if maybe the other had not hidden behind that beard against this very dayp and if sop whyp whyp thinking but whyp whyp since he wanted so littlep could have understood if the other had wanted the signal to be in secretp would have been quick and glad to let it be in secret even if he could not have understood whyp thinking in the middle of this my godp i am youngp youngp and i didnpt even know itp they didnpt even tell mep that i was youngp feeling that same despair and shame like when you have to watch your father fail in physical couragep thinking it should have been me that failedp mep ip not he who stemmed from that blood which we both bear before it could have become corrupt and tainted by whatever it was in motherps that he could not brookp pwaitpp shreve criedp though quentin had not spokenp it had been merely some qualityp some gathering of quentinps still laxed and hunched figure which presaged speechp because shreve said waitp waitp before quentin could have begun to speakp pbecause he hadnpt even looked at herp ohp he had seen her all rightp he had had plenty of opportunity for thatp he could not have helped but that because mrs sutpen would have seen to it p ten days of that kind of planned and arranged and executed privacies like the campaigns of dead generals in the text booksp in libraries and parlors and drives in the buggy in the afternoons p all planned three months ago when mrs sutpen read henryps first letter with bonps name in itp until maybe even judith too began to feel like the other one to a pair of goldfishp and him even talking to her toop or what talking he could have found to do to a country girl who probably never saw a man young or old before who sooner or later didnpt smell like manurep talking to her about like he would talk to the old dame on the gold chairs in the parlorp except that in the one case he would have to make all the conversation and in the other he would not even be able to make his own escape but would have to wait for henry to come and get himp and maybe he had even thought about her by that timep maybe at the times when he would be telling himself it cant be sop he could not look at me like this every day and make no sign if it were so he would even tell himself she would be easy like when you have left the champagne on the supper table and are walking toward the whiskey on the sideboard and you happen to pass a cup of lemon sherbet on a tray and you look at the sherbet and tell yourselfp that would be easy too only who wants itp p  p does that suit youpp pbut itps not lovepp quentin saidp pbecause why notp because listenp what was it the old damep the aunt rosap told you about how there are some things that just have to be whether they are or notp have to be a damn sight more than some other things that maybe are and it dont matter a damn whether they are or notp that was itp he just didnpt have time yetp jesusp he must have known it would bep like that lawyer thoughtp he wasnpt a foolp the trouble wasp he wasnpt the kind of notpfool the lawyer thought he would bep he must have known it was going to happenp it would be like you passed that sherbet and maybe you knew you would even reach the sideboard and the whiskeyp yet you knew that tomorrow morning you would want that sherbetp then you reached the whiskey and you knew you wanted that sherbet nowp maybe you didnpt even go to the sideboardp maybe you even looked back at that champagne on the supper table among the dirty haviland and the crumpled damaskp and all of a sudden you knew you didnpt want to go back there evenp it would be no question of choosingp having to choose between the champagne or whiskey and the sherbetp but all of a sudden pit would be spring thenp in that country where he had never spent a spring before and you said north mississippi is a little harder country than louisianap with dogwood and violets and the early scentless flowers but the earth and the nights still a little cold and the hard tight sticky buds like young girlsp nipples on alder and judas trees and beech and maple and even something young in the cedars like he never saw beforep you find that you dont want anything but that sherbet and that you havenpt been wanting anything else but that and you have been wanting that pretty hard for some time p besides knowing that that sherbet is there for you to takep not just for anybody to take but for you to takep knowing just from looking at that cup that it would be like a flower thatp if any other hand reached for itp it would have thorns on it but not for your handp and him not used to that since all the other cups that had been willing and easy for him to take up hadnpt contained sherbet but champagne or at least kitchen winep and more than thatp there was the knowing what he suspected might be sop or not knowing if it was so or notp and who to say if it wasnpt maybe the possibility of incestp because who pwithout a sisterp i dont know about the othersp has been in love and not discovered the vain evanescence of the fleshly encounterp who has not had to realise that when the brief all is done you must retreat from both love and pleasurep gather up your own rubbish and refuse p the hats and pants and shoes which you drag through the world p and retreat since the gods condone and practise these and the dreamy immeasurable coupling which floats oblivious above the trammelling and harried instantp thep waspnotp isp wasp is a perquisite only of balloony and weightless elephants and whalesp but maybe if there were sin too maybe you would not be permitted to escapep uncouplep returnp p aint that rightpp he ceasedp he could have been interrupted easily nowp quentin could have spoken nowp but quentin did notp he just sat as beforep his hands in his trousers pocketsp his shoulders hugged inward and hunchedp his face lowered and he looking somehow curiously smaller than he actually was because of his actual height and spareness p that quality of delicacy about the bonesp articulationp which even at twenty still had something about itp some last echo about itp of adolescence p that isp as compared with the cherubic burliness of the other who faced himp who looked youngerp whose very superiority in bulk and displacement made him look even youngerp as a plump boy of twelve who outweighs the other by twenty or thirty pounds still looks younger than the boy of fourteen who had that plumpness once and lost itp sold it pwhether with his consent or notp for that state of virginity which is neither boyps nor girlpsp pi dont knowpp quentin saidp pall rightpp shreve saidp pmaybe i dont eitherp onlyp jesusp some day you are bound to fall in lovep they just wouldnpt beat you that wayp it would be like if god had got jesus born and saw that he had the carpenter tools and then never gave him anything to build with themp dont you believe thatpp pi dont knowpp quentin saidp he did not movep shreve looked at himp even while they were not talking their breaths in the tomblike air vaporised gently and quietlyp the chimes for midnight would have rung some time ago nowp pyou meanp it dont matter to youpp quentin did not answerp pthatps rightp dont say itp because i would know you are lyingp p all right thenp listenp because he never had to worry about the love because that would take care of itselfp maybe he knew there was a fatep a doom on himp like what the old aunt rosa told you about some things that just have to be whether they are or notp just to balance the booksp write paid on the old sheet so that whoever keeps them can take it out of the ledger and burn itp get rid of itp maybe he knew then that whatever the old man had donep whether he meant well or ill by itp it wasnpt going to be the old man who would have to pay the checkp and now that the old man was bankrupt with the incompetence of agep who should do the paying if not his sonsp his getp because wasnpt it done that way in the old daysp the old abraham full of years and weak and incapable now of further harmp caught at last and the captains and the collectors sayingp pold manp we dont want youp and abraham would sayp ppraise the lordp i have raised about me sons to bear the burden of mine iniquities and persecutionsp yeap perhaps even to restore my flocks and herds from the hand of the ravisherp that i might rest mine eyes upon my goods and chattelsp upon the generations of them and of my descendants increased an hundred fold as my soul goeth out from mepp he knew all the time that the love would take care of itselfp maybe that was why he didnpt have to think about her during those three months between that september and that christmas while henry talked about her to himp saying every time he breathedp hers and my lives are to exist within and upon yoursp did not need to waste any time over the love after it happenedp backfired on himp why he never bothered to write her any letters pexcept that last onep which she would want to savep why he never actually proposed to her and gave her a ring for mrs sutpen to show aroundp because the fate was on her toop the same old abraham who was so old and weak now nobody would want him in the flesh on any debtp maybe he didnpt even have to wait for that christmas to see her to know thisp maybe thatps what it was that came out of the three months of henryps talking that he heard without listening top i am not hearing about a young girlp a virginp i am hearing about a narrow delicate fenced virgin field already furrowed and bedded so that all i shall need to do is drop the seeds inp caress it smooth againp saw her that christmas and knew it for certain and then forgot itp went back to school and did not even remember that he had forgotten itp because he did not have time thenp maybe it was just one day in that spring you told about when he stopped and saidp right quietp all rightp i want to go to bed with who might be my sisterp all right and then forgot that toop because he didnpt have timep that isp he didnpt have anything else but timep because he had to waitp but not for herp that was all fixedp it was the otherp maybe he thought it would be in the mail bag each time the nigger rode over from sutpenps hundred and henry believing it was the letter from her that he was waiting for when what he was thinking was maybe he will write it thenp he would just have to write pi am your fatherp burn thisp and i would do itp or if not thatp a sheet a scrap of paper with the one word pcharlesp in his handp and i would know what he meant and he would not even have to ask me to burn itp or a lock of his hair or a paring from his finger nail and i would know them because i believe now that i have known what his hair and his finger nails would look like all my lifep could choose that lock and that paring out of a thousandp and it did not comep and his letter went to her every two weeks and hers came back to himp and maybe he thought if one of mine to her should come back to me unopened thenp that would be a signp and that didnpt happenp and then henry began to talk about his stopping at sutpenps hundred for a day or so on his way home and he said all right to itp said it will be henry who will get the letterp the letter saying it is inconvenient for me to come at that timep so apparently he does not intend to acknowledge me as his sonp but at least i shall have forced him to admit that i amp and that one did not come either and the date was set and the family at sutpenps hundred notified of it and that letter did not come either and he thought it will be thenp i wronged himp maybe this is what he has been waiting for and maybe his heart sprang thenp maybe he said yesp yesp i will renounce herp i will renounce love and allp that will be cheapp cheapp even though he say to me pnever look upon my face againp take my love and my acknowledgement in secretp and gop i will do thatp i will not even demand to know of him what it was my mother did that justified his action toward her and mep so the day came and he and henry rode the forty miles againp into the gates and up the drive to the housep he knew what would be there p the woman whom he had seen once and seen throughp the girl whom he had seen through without even having to see oncep the man whom he had seen dailyp watched out of his fearful intensity of need and had never penetratedp p the mother who had taken henry aside before they had been six hours in the house on that christmas visit and informed him of the engagement almost before the fiance had had time to associate the daughterps name with the daughterps facep so that probably before they even reached school againp and without his being aware that he had done sop henry had already told bon what was in his motherps mind pwho had already told bon what was in hispp so that maybe before they even started on bonps second visit p pit would be june now and what would it be in north mississippip what was it you saidp the magnolias in bloom and the mockingbirdsp and in fifty years morep after they had gone and fought it and lost it and come back homep the decoration day and the veterans in the neat brushed handpironed gray and the spurious bronze medals that never meant anything to begin withp and the chosen young girls in white dresses bound at the waist with crimson sashes and the band would play dixie and all the old doddering men would yell that you would not have thought would have had wind enough to get therep walk down town to sit on the rostrum evenp p it would be june nowp with the magnolias and mockingbirds in the moonlight and the curtains blowing in the june air of commencement and the musicp fiddles and trianglesp inside among the swirling and dipping hoopsp and henry would be a little tightp that should have been saying pi demand to know your intentions toward my sisterp but wasnpt saying itp instead maybe blushing again even in the moonlightp but standing straight and blushing because when you are proud enough to be humble you dont have to cringe pwho every time he breathed over his vocal cords he was saying we belong to youp do as you will with uspp saying pi used to think that i would hate the man that i would have to look at every day and whose every move and action and speech would say to mep i have seen and touched parts of your sisterps body that you will never see and touchp and now i know that i shall hate him and thatps why i want that man to be youpp knowing that bon would know what he meantp was trying to sayp tell himp thinkingp telling himself phenrypp not just because he is older than i am and has known more than i shall ever know and has remembered more of itp but because of my own free willp and whether i knew it at the time or not does not matterp i gave my life and judithps both to him p  p p pthatps still not lovepp quentin saidp pall rightpp shreve saidp pjust listenp p  p rode the forty miles and into the gates and up to the housep and this time sutpen wasnpt even therep and ellen didnpt even know where he had gonep believing blandly and volubly that he had gone to memphis or maybe even to saint louis on businessp and henry and judith not even caring that muchp and only hep bonp to know where sutpen had gonep saying to himself of coursep he wasnpt surep he had to go there to make surep telling himself that loud nowp loud and fast too so he would notp could notp hear the thinkingp the but if he suspectedp why not have told mep i would have done thatp gone to him firstp who have the blood after it was tainted and corrupt by whatever it was in motherp loud and fast nowp telling himself thatps what it isp maybe he has gone on ahead to wait for mep he left no message for me here because the others are not to suspect yet and he knows that i will know at once where he is when i find him gonep thinking of the two of themp the sombre vengeful woman who was his mother and the grim rocklike man who had looked at him every day for ten days with absolutely no alteration of expression at allp facing one another in grim armistice after almost thirty years in that rich baroque drawing room in that house which he called home since apparently everybody seemed to have to have a homep the man who he was now sure was his father not humble now either pand hep bonp proud of thatpp not saying even now i was wrong but i admit that it is so p jesusp think of his heart thenp during those two daysp with the old gal throwing judith at him every minute now because she had been spreading the news of the engagement confidentially through the county ever since christmas p didnpt your father say how she had even taken judith to memphis in the spring to buy the trousseaup p and judith neither having to accede to the throwing nor to resist it but just beingp just existing and breathing like henry did who maybe one morning during that spring waked up and lay right still in the bed and took stockp added the figures and drew the balance and told himselfp all rightp i am trying to make myself into what i think he wants me to bep he can do anything he wants to with mep he has only to tell me what to do and i will do itp even though what he asked me to do looked to me like dishonorp i would still do itp only judithp being a female and so wiser than thatp would not even consider dishonorp she would just sayp all rightp i will do anything he might ask me to do and that is why he will never ask me to do anything that i consider dishonorablep so that pmaybe he even kissed her that timep the first time she had ever been kissed maybe and she too innocent to be coy or modest or even to know that she had been temporised withp maybe afterward just looking at him with a kind of peaceful and blank surprise at the fact that your sweetheart apparently kissed you the first time like your brother would p provided of course that your brother ever thought ofp could be brought top kissing you on the mouthp p so that when the two days were up and he was gone again and ellen shrieking at herp pwhatp no engagementp no trothp no ringpp she would be too astonished even to lie about it because that would be the first time it would have occurred to her that there had been no proposalp p think of his heart thenp while he rode to the riverp and then on the steamboat itself where he walked up and down the deckp feeling through the deck the engines driving him nearer and nearer day and night to the moment which he must have realised now he had been waiting for ever since he had got big enough to comprehendp of course every now and then he would have to say it pretty fast and loudp thatps all it isp he just wants to make sure first to drown out the old but why do it this wayp why not back therep he knows that i shall never make any claim upon any part of what he now possessesp gained at the price of what sacrifice and endurance and scorn pso they told mep not hep theyp only he knowsp knows that so well that it would never have occurred to him just as he knows it would never occur to me that this might be his reasonp who is not only generous but ruthlessp who must have surrendered everything he and mother owned to her and to me as the price of repudiating herp not because the doing it this way hurt himp flouted him and kept him in suspense that much unnecessary longerp because he didnpt matterp whether he was irked or even crucified didnpt matterp it was the fact that he had to be kept constantly reminded that he would not have done it this way himselfp yet he had stemmed from the blood after whatever it was his mother had been or done had tainted and corrupted itp p nearer and nearerp until suspense and puzzlement and haste and all seemed blended into one sublimation of passive surrender in which he thought only all rightp all rightp even this wayp even if he wants to do it this wayp i will promise never to see her againp never to see him againp then he reached homep and he never learned if sutpen had been there or notp he never knewp he believed itp but he never knew p his mother the same sombre unchanged fierce paranoiac whom he had left in septemberp from whom he could learn nothing by indirection and whom he dared not ask outright p the very fact that he saw through the skillful questions of the lawyer pas to how he had liked the school and the people of that country and how perhaps p or had he not perhapsp p he had made friends up there among the country familiesp only that much more proof to him at that time that sutpen had not been therep or at least the lawyer was not aware that he hadp since now that he believed he had fathomed the lawyerps design in sending him to that particular school to begin withp he saw nothing in the questions to indicate that the lawyer had learned anything new sincep por what he could have learned in that interview with the lawyerp because it would be a short onep it would be next to the shortest one ever to transpire between themp the shortest one of all next to the last one of coursep the one which would occur in the next summerp when henry would be with himpp because the lawyer would not dare risk asking him outrightp just as he pbonp did not dare to ask his mother outrightp becausep though the lawyer believed him to be rather a fool than dull or densep yet even he pthe lawyerp never for one moment believed that even bon was going to be the kind of a fool he was going to bep so he told the lawyer nothing and the lawyer told him nothingp and the summer passed and september came and still the lawyer phis mother toop had not once asked him if he wanted to return to the schoolp so that at last he had to say it himselfp that he intended to returnp and maybe he knew that he had lost that move since there was nothing whatever in the lawyerps face save an agentps acquiescencep so he returned to schoolp where henry was waiting poh yesp waitingp for himp who did not even say pyou didnpt answer my lettersp you didnpt even write to judithp who had already said what my sister and i have and are belongs to you but maybe he did write to judith nowp by the first nigger post which rode to sutpenps hundredp about how it had been an uneventful summer and hence nothing to write aboutp with maybe charles bon plain and inelidible on the outside of the envelope and he thinking he will have to see thatp maybe he will send it back thinking maybe if it comes back nothing will stop me then and so maybe at last i will know what i am going to dop but it didnpt come backp and the others didnpt come backp and the fall passed and christmas came and they rode again to sutpenps hundred and this time he was not there againp he was in the fieldp he had gone to townp he was hunting p somethingp sutpen not there when they rode up and bon knew he had not expected him to be therep saying nowp nowp nowp it will come nowp it will come this timep and i am youngp youngp because i still dont know what i am going to dop so maybe what he was doing that twilight pbecause he knew that sutpen had returnedp was now in the housep it would be like a windp somethingp dark and chillp breathing upon him and he stoppingp gravep quietp alertp thinking whatp what is itp then he would knowp he could feel the other entering the housep and he would let his held breath go quiet and easyp a profound exhalationp his heart quiet toop in the garden while he walked with judith and talked to herp gallant and elegant and automatic pand judith thinking about that like she thought about that first kiss back in the summerp so thatps itp thatps what love isp bludgeoned once more by disappointment but still unbowedpp p maybe what he was doing there now was waitingp telling himself maybe even yet he will send for mep at least say it to me even though he knew betterp he is in the library nowp he has sent the nigger for henryp now henry is entering the roomp so that maybe he stopped and faced herp with something in his face that was smiling nowp and took her by the elbows and turned herp easy and gentlep until she faced the housep and said pgop i wish to be alone to think about lovep and she went just as she took the kiss that dayp with maybe the feel of the flat of his hand light and momentary upon her behindp and he stood there facing the house until henry came outp and they looked at one another for a while with no word said and then turned and walked together through the gardenp across the lot and into the stablep where maybe there was a nigger there and maybe they saddled the two horses themselves and waited until the house nigger came with the two repacked saddlebagsp and maybe he didnpt even say thenp pbut he sent no word to mepp p shreve ceasedp that isp for all the two of themp shreve and quentinp knew he had stoppedp since for all the two of them knew he had never begunp since it did not matter pand possibly neither of them conscious of the distinctionp which one had been doing the talkingp so that now it was not two but four of them riding the two horses through the dark over the frozen december ruts of that christmas evep four of them and then just two p charlespshreve and quentinphenryp the two of them both believing that henry was thinking he pmeaning his fatherp has destroyed us allp not for one moment thinking he pmeaning bonp must have known or at least suspected this all the timep thatps why he has acted as he hasp why he did not answer my letters last summer nor write to judithp why he has never asked her to marry himp believing that that must have occurred to henryp certainly during that moment after henry emerged from the house and he and bon looked at one another for a while without a word then walked down to the stable and saddled the horsesp but that henry had just taken that in stride because he did not yet believe it even though he knew that it was truep because he must have now understood with complete despair the secret of his whole attitude toward bon from that first instinctive moment when he had seen him a year and a quarter agop he knewp yet he did notp had to refuse top believep so it was four of them who rode the two horses through that night and then across the bright frosty north mississippi christmas dayp in something very like pariahphood passing the plantation houses with sprigs of holly thrust beneath the knockers on the doors and mistletoe hanging from the chandeliers and bowls of eggnog and toddy on tables in the halls and the blue unwinded wood smoke standing above the plastered chimneys of the slave quartersp to the river and the steamboatp there would be christmas on the boat toop the same holly and mistletoep the same eggnog and toddyp perhapsp doubtlessp a christmas supper and a ballp but not for themp the two of them in the dark and the cold standing at the guard rail above the dark water and still not talking since there was nothing to sayp the two of them pthe four of themp held in that probationp that suspensionp by henry who knew but still did not believep who was going deliberately to look upon and prove to himself that whichp so shreve and quentin believedp would be like death for him to learnp so it was four of them still who got off the boat in new orleansp which henry had never seen before pwhose entire cosmopolitan experiencep apart from his sojourn at the schoolp consisted probably of one or two trips to memphis with his father to buy live stock or slavesp and had no time to look at now p henry who knew yet did not believep and bon whom mr compson had called a fatalist but whop according to shreve and quentinp did not resist henryps dictum and design for the reason that he neither knew nor cared what henry intended to do because he had long since realised that he did not know yet what he himself was going to dop p four of them who sat in that drawing room of baroque and fusty magnificence which shreve had invented and which was probably true enoughp while the haitipborn daughter of the french sugar planter and the woman who sutpenps first fatherpinplaw had told him was a spaniard pthe slight dowdy woman with untidy graypstreaked raven hair coarse as a horseps tailp with parchmentpcolored skin and implacable pouched black eyes which alone showed no age because they showed no forgettingp whom shreve and quentin had likewise invented and which was likewise probably true enoughp told them nothing because she did not need to because she had already told itp who did not sayp pmy son is in love with your sisterpp but pso she has fallen in love with himp and then sat laughing harshly and steadily at henry who could not have lied to her even if he would havep who did not even have to answer at all either yes or nop p four of them therep in that room in new orleans in 1860p just as in a sense there were four of them here in this tomblike room in massachusetts in 1910p and bon may havep probably didp take henry to call on the octoroon mistress and the childp as mr compson saidp though neither shreve nor quentin believed that the visit affected henry as mr compson seemed to thinkp in factp quentin did not even tell shreve what his father had said about the visitp perhaps quentin himself had not been listening when mr compson related precreatedpp it that evening at homep perhaps at that moment on the gallery in the hot september twilight quentin took that in stride without even hearing it just as shreve would havep since both he and shreve believed p and were probably right in this too p that the octoroon and the child would have been to henry only something else about bon to bep not envied but aped if that had been possiblep if there had been time and peace to ape it in p peace not between men of the same race and nation but peace between two young embattled spirits and the incontrovertible fact which embattled themp since neither henry and bonp anymore than quentin and shrevep were the first young men to believe por at least apparently act on the assumptionp that wars were sometimes created for the sole aim of settling youthps private difficulties and discontentsp pso the old dame asked henry that one question and then sat there laughing at himp so he knew thenp they both knew thenp and so now it would be shortp this time with the lawyerp the shortest one of allp because the lawyer would have been watching himp maybe there had even been a letter during that second fall while the lawyer was waiting and still nothing seemed to be happening up there pand maybe the lawyer was the reason why bon never answered henryps and judithps letters during that summerp because he never got themp p a letterp two or maybe three pages of your humble and obedient e and t and c that boiled down to eighteen words i know you are a foolp but just what kind of a fool are you going to bep and bon was at least enough of a notpfool to do the boiling downp p yesp watching himp not concerned yetp just considerably annoyedp giving bon plenty of time to come to himp giving him all of a week maybe pafter he p the lawyer p would have contrived to get hold of henry and find out a good deal of what henry was thinking without henry ever knowing itp before he would contrive bon toop and maybe so good at the contriving that even bon would not know at once what was comingp it would be a short onep it would be no secret between them nowp it would just be unsaidp the lawyer behind the desk pand maybe in the secret drawer the ledger where he had just finished adding in the last past yearps interest compounded between the intrinsic and the love and pride at two hundred percentpp p the lawyer frettedp annoyedp but not at all concerned since he not only knew he had the screwsp but he still did not really believe that bon was that kind of a foolp though he was about to alter his opinion somewhat about the dullnessp or at least the backwardnessp p the lawyer watching him and sayingp smooth and oilyp since it would be no secret nowp who would know now that bon knew all he would ever know or would need to know to make the coupp pdo you know that you are a very fortunate young manp with most of usp even when we are lucky enough to get our revengep we must pay for itp sometimes in actual dollarsp while you are not only in a position to get your revengep clear your motherps namep but the balm with which you will assuage her injury will have a collateral value which can be translated into the things which a young man needsp which are his due and whichp whether we like it or notp may be had only in exchange for hard dollars p  p p and bon not saying what do you meanp and not moving yetp that isp the lawyer would not be aware that he was beginning to movep continuing pthe lawyerp smooth and easyp pand more than thisp than the revengep as lagniappe to the revenge as it werep this nosegay of an afternoonp this scentless prairie flower which will not be missed and which might as well bloom in your lapel as in anotherpsp this p how do you young men put itp p a nice little piece p  p p and then he would see bonp maybe the eyesp maybe he would just hear the feet movingp and thenp pistol pderringerp horse pistolp revolverp whatever it wasp and allp he would be crouched back against the wall behind the overturned chairp snarlingp pstand backp stoppp then screaming phelpp helpp he p  p pp then just screamingp because he would hear and feel his own wrenching bones before he could free his fingers of the pistolp and his neck bone too as bon would strike him with the palm on one cheek and then with the back of the hand on the otherp maybe he could even hear bon too sayingp pstop itp hushp ipm not going to hurt youp or maybe it was the lawyer in him that said the hush which he obeyedp who got him back into the righted chair againp half lying upon the deskp the lawyer in him that warned him not to say you will pay for this but instead to half lie therep nursing his wrenched hand in his handkerchief while bon stood looking down at himp holding the pistol by the barrel against his legp sayingp pif you feel that you require satisfactionp of course you know p  p p and the lawyerp sitting back nowp dabbing the handkerchief at his cheek nowp pi was wrongp i misunderstood your feeling about the matterp i ask your pardonp and bonp pgrantedp as you wishp i will accept either an apology or a bulletp as you preferp and the lawyer pthere would be a faint fading red in his cheekp but that would be allp nothing in the voice or in the eyespp pi see you are going to collect full measure for my unfortunate misconception p even ridiculep even if i felt that right was on my side pwhich i do notp i would still have to decline your offerp i would not be your equal with pistolsp and bonp pnor with knives or rapiers toopp and the lawyerp smooth and easyp pnor knives or rapiers toopp so that now the lawyer wouldnpt even need to say you will pay for this because bon would be saying that for himp who would stand there with the lax pistolp thinking but only with knives or pistols or rapiersp so i cant beat himp i could shoot himp i would shoot him with no more compunction than i would a snake or a man who cuckolded mep but he would still beat mep thinking yesp he did beat me while he p he p pplistenpp shreve saidp criedp pit would be while he would be lying in a bedroom of that private house in corinth after pittsburg landing while his shoulder got well two years later and the letter from the octoroon pmaybe even the one that contained the photograph of her and the childp finally overtaking himp wailing for money and telling him that the lawyer had departed for texas or mexico or somewhere at last and that she pthe octoroonp could not find his mother either and so without doubt the lawyer had murdered her before he stole the moneyp since it would be just like both of them to flee or get themselves killed without providing for her at allppp p yesp they knew nowp and jesusp think of himp bonp who had wanted to knowp who had had the most reason to want to knowp who as far as he knew had never had any father but had been created somehow between that woman who wouldnpt let him play with other childrenp and that lawyer who even told the woman whether or not each time she bought a piece of meat or a loaf of bread p two people neither of whom had taken pleasure or found passion in getting him or suffered pain and travail in borning him p who perhaps if one of the two had only told him the truthp none of what happened would ever have come to passp while there was henry who had father and security and contentment and allp yet was told the truth by both of them while he pbonp was told by neitherp and think of henryp who had said at first it was a lie and then when he knew it was not a lie had still said pi dont believe itpp who had found even in that pi dont believe itp enough of strength to repudiate home and blood in order to champion his defiancep and in which championing he proved his contention to be the false one and was more than ever interdict against returning homep jesusp think of the load he had to carryp born of two methodists por of one long invincible line of methodistsp and raised in provincial north mississippip faced with incestp incest of all things that might have been reserved for himp that all his heredity and training had to rebel against on principlep and in a situation where he knew that neither incest nor training was going to help him solve itp so that maybe when they left and walked the streets that night and at last bon saidp pwellp now whatpp henry saidp pwaitp waitp let me get used to itpp and maybe it was two days or three daysp and henry saidp pyou shall notp shall notp and then it was bon that saidp pwaitp i am your older brotherp do you say shall not to mepp and maybe it was a weekp maybe bon took henry to see the octoroon and henry looked at her and saidp paint that enough for youpp and bon saidp pdo you want it to be enoughpp and henry saidp pwaitp waitp i must have time to get used to itp you will have to give me timepp jesusp think how henry must have talked during that winter and then that spring with lincoln elected and the alabama convention and the south began to draw out of the unionp and then there were two presidents in the united states and the telegraph brought the news about charleston and lincoln called out his army and it was donep irrevocable nowp and henry and bon already decided to go without having to consult one anotherp who would have gone anyway even if they had never seen one another but certainly nowp because after all you dont waste a warp p think how they must have talkedp how henry would sayp pbut must you marry herp do you have to do itpp and bon would sayp phe should have told mep he should have told mep myselfp himselfp i was fair and honorable with himp i waitedp you know now why i waitedp i gave him every chance to tell me himselfp but he didnpt do itp if he hadp i would have agreed and promised never to see her or you or him againp but he didnpt tell mep i thought at first it was because he didnpt knowp then i knew that he did knowp and still i waitedp but he didnpt tell mep he just told youp sent me a message like you send a command by a nigger servant to a beggar or a tramp to clear outp dont you see thatpp and henry would sayp pbut judithp our sisterp think of herp and bonp pall rightp think of herp then whatpp because they both knew what judith would do when she found it out because they both knew that women will show pride and honor about almost anything except lovep and henry saidp pyesp i seep i understandp but you will have to give me time to get used to itp you are my older brotherp you can do that little for mepp think of the two of themp bon who didnpt know what he was going to do and had to sayp pretendp he didp and henry who knew what he was going to do and had to say he didnptp then it was christmas againp then 1861p and they hadnpt heard from judith because judith didnpt know for sure where they were because henry wouldnpt let bon write to her yetp then they heard about the companyp the university graysp organising up at oxford and maybe they had been waiting for thatp so they took the steamboat north againp and more gayety and excitement on the boat now than christmas evenp like it always is when a war startsp before the scene gets cluttered up with bad food and wounded soldiers and widows and orphansp and them taking no part in it now either but standing at the rail again above the churning waterp and maybe it would be two or three daysp then henry said suddenlyp cried suddenlyp pbut kings have done itp even dukesp there was that lorraine duke named john something that married his sisterp the pope excommunicated him but it didnpt hurtp it didnpt hurtp they were still husband and wifep they were still alivep they still lovedpp then againp loudp fastp pbut you will have to waitp you will have to give me timep maybe the war will settle it and we wont need topp and maybe this was one place where your old man was rightp and they rode into oxford without touching sutpenps hundred and signed the company roster and then hid somewhere to waitp and henry let bon write judith one letterp they would send it by handp by a nigger that would steal into the quarters by night and give it to judithps maidp and judith sent the picture in the metal case and they rode on ahead to wait until the company got through making flags and riding about the state telling girls farewell and started for the frontp pjesusp think of themp because bon would know what henry was doingp just as he had always known what henry was thinking since that first day when they had looked at one anotherp maybe he would know all the better what henry was doing because he did not know what he himself was going to dop that he would not know until all of a sudden some day it would burst clear and he would know then that he had known all the time what it would bep so he didnpt have to bother about himself and so all he had to do was just to watch henry trying to reconcile what he phenryp knew he was going to do with all the voices of his heredity and training which said nop nop you cannotp you must notp you shall not maybe they would even be under fire nowp with the shells rushing and rumbling past overhead and bursting and them lying there waiting to charge and henry would cry againp pbut that lorraine duke did itp there must have been lots in the world who have done it that people dont know aboutp that maybe they suffered for it and died for it and are in hell now for itp but they did it and it dont matter nowp even the ones we do know about are just names now and it dont matter nowp and bon watching him and listening to him and thinking itps because i dont know myself what i am going to do and so he is aware that i am undecided without knowing that he is awarep perhaps if i told him now that i am going to do itp he would know his own mind and tell mep you shall notp and maybe your old man was right this time and they did think maybe the war would settle it and they would not have to themselvesp or at least maybe henry hoped it would because maybe your old man was right here too and bon didnpt carep that since both of the two people who could have given him a father had declined to do itp nothing mattered to him nowp revenge or love or allp since he knew now that revenge could not compensate him nor love assuagep maybe it wasnpt even henry who wouldnpt let him write to judith but bon himself who did not write her because he didnpt care about anythingp not even that he didnpt know yet what he was going to dop then it was the next year and bon was an officer now and they were moving toward shiloh without knowing that eitherp talking again as they moved along in columnp the officer dropping back alongside the file in which the private marched and henry crying againp holding his desperate and urgent voice down to undertonep pdont you know yet what you are going to dopp while bon would look at him for a moment with that expression which could have been smilingp psuppose i told you i did not intend to go back to herpp and henry would walk there beside himp with his pack and his eight feet of musketp and he would begin to pantp panting and panting while bon watched himp pi am out in front of you a lot nowp going into battlep chargingp i will be out in front of you p  p p and henry pantingp pstopp stoppp and bon watching him with that faint thin expression about the mouth and eyesp p p  p and who would ever knowp you would not even have to know for certain yourselfp because who could say but what a yankee ball might have struck me at the exact second you pulled your triggerp or even before p  p p and henry panting and lookingp glaring at the skyp with his teeth showing and the sweat on his face and the knuckles of the hand on his musket butt whitep sayingp pantingp pstopp stopp stopp stoppp then it was shilohp the second day and the lost battle and the brigade falling back from pittsburg landing p  p and listenpp shreve criedp pwaitp nowp waitpp pglaring at quentinp panting himselfp as if he had had to supply his shade not only with a cue but with breath to obey it inpp pbecause your old man was wrong herep toop he said it was bon who was woundedp but it wasnptp because who told himp who told sutpenp or your grandfather eitherp which of them it was who was hitp sutpen didnpt know because he wasnpt therep and your grandfather wasnpt there either because that was where he was hit toop where he lost his armp so who told themp not henryp because his father never saw henry but that one time and maybe they never had time to talk about wounds and besides to talk about wounds in the confederate army in 1865 would be like coal miners talking about sootp and not bonp because sutpen never saw him at all because he was deadp p it was not bonp it was henryp bon that found henry at last and stooped to pick him up and henry fought backp struggledp sayingp plet bep let me diep i wont have to know it thenp and bon saidp pso you do want me to go back to herp and henry lay there struggling and pantingp with the sweat on his face and his teeth bloody inside his chewed lipp and bon saidp psay you do want me to go back to herp maybe then i wont do itp say itp and henry lay there strugglingp with the fresh red staining through his shirt and his teeth showing and the sweat on his face until bon held his arms and lifted him onto his back p  p p firstp two of themp then fourp now two againp the room was indeed tomblikep a quality stale and static and moribund beyond any mere vivid and living coldp yet they remained in itp though not thirty feet away was bed and warmthp quentin had not even put on his overcoatp which lay on the floor where it had fallen from the arm of the chair where shreve had put it downp they did not retreat from the coldp they both bore it as though in deliberate flagellant exaltation of physical misery transmogrified into the spiritsp travail of the two young men during that time fifty years agop or fortypeight ratherp then fortypseven and then fortypsixp since it was p64 and then p65 and the starved and ragged remnant of an army having retreated across alabama and georgia and into carolinap swept onward not by a victorious army behind it but rather by a mounting tide of the names of lost battles from either side p chickamauga and franklinp vicksburg and corinth and atlanta p battles lost not alone because of superior numbers and failing ammunition and storesp but because of generals who should not have been generalsp who were generals not through training in contemporary methods or aptitude for learning themp but by the divine right to say pgo therep conferred upon them by an absolute caste systemp or because the generals of it never lived long enough to learn how to fight massed cautious accretionary battlesp since they were already as obsolete as richard or roland or du guesclinp who wore plumes and cloaks lined with scarlet at twentypeight and thirty and thirtyptwo and captured warships with cavalry charges but no grain nor meat nor bulletsp who would whip three separate armies in as many days and then tear down their own fences to cook meat robbed from their own smokehousesp who on one night and with a handful of men would gallantly set fire to and destroy a million dollar garrison of enemy supplies and on the next night be discovered by a neighbor in bed with his wife and be shot to deathp p twop fourp now two againp according to quentin and shrevep the two the four the two still talking p the one who did not yet know what he was going to dop the other who knew what he would have to do yet could not reconcile himself p henry citing himself authority for incestp talking about his duke john of lorraine as if he hoped possibly to evoke that condemned and excommunicated shade to tell him in person that it was all rightp as people both before and since have tried to evoke god or devil to justify them in what their glands insisted uponp p the two the four the two facing one another in the tomblike roomp shrevep the canadianp the child of blizzards and of cold in a bathrobe with an overcoat above itp the collar turned up about his earsp quentinp the southernerp the morose and delicate offspring of rain and steamy heat in the thin suitable clothing which he had brought from mississippip his overcoat pas thin and vain for what it was as the suitp lying on the floor where he had not even bothered to raise itp p p the winter of p64 nowp the army retreated across alabamap into georgiap now carolina was just at their backs and bonp the officerp thinking pwe will either be caught and annihilated or old joe will extricate us and we will make contact with lee in front of richmond and then we will at least have the privilege of surrenderpp and then one day all of a sudden he thought of itp rememberedp how that jefferson regiment of which his father was now colonel was in longstreetps corpsp and maybe from that moment the whole purpose of the retreat seemed to him to be that of bringing him within reach of his fatherp to give his father one more chancep so that it must have seemed to him now that he knew at last why he had not been able to decide what he wanted to dop maybe he thought for just a secondp pmy godp i am still youngp even after these four years i am still youngp but just for a secondp because maybe in the same breath he saidp pall rightp then i am youngp but i still believep even though what i believe probably is that warp sufferingp these four years of keeping his men alive and able in order to swap them blood and flesh for the largest amount of ground at its bargain pricep will have changed him pwhich i know that it does not dop to where he will say to me notp forgive mep butp you are my oldest sonp protect your sisterp never see either of us againpp then it was p65 and what was left of the army of the west with nothing remaining now but the ability to walk backward slow and stubborn and to endure musketry and shellingp maybe they didnpt even miss the shoes and overcoats and food any more now and that was why he could write about the captured stove polish like he did in the letter to judith when he finally knew what he was going to do at last and told henry and henry said pthank godp thank godpp not for the incest of course but because at last they were going to do somethingp at last he could be something even though that something was the irrevocable repudiation of the old heredity and training and the acceptance of eternal damnationp maybe he could even quit talking about his lorraine duke thenp because he could say nowp pit isnpt yours nor his nor the popeps hell that we are all going top itps my motherps and her motherps and fatherps and their mothersp and fathersp hellp and it isnpt you who are going therep but wep the three p nop four of usp and so at least we will all be together where we belongp since even if only he went there we would still have to be there too since the three of us are just illusions that he begotp and your illusions are a part of you like your bones and flesh and memoryp and we will all be together in torment and so we will not need to remember love and fornicationp and maybe in torment you cannot even remember why you are therep and if we cannot remember all thisp it cant be much tormentpp then they were in carolinap that january and february of p65 and what was left of them had been walking backward for almost a year now and the distance between them and richmond was less far than the distance they had comep the distance between them and the end a good deal less farp but to bon it was not the space between them and defeat but the space between him and the other regimentp between him and the hourp the momentp phe will not even have to ask mep i will just touch flesh with him and i will say it myselfp you will not need to worryp she shall never see me againpp then march in carolina and still the walking backward slow and stubborn and listening to the northward now because there was nothing to hear from any other direction because in all the other directions it was finished nowp and all they expected to hear from the north was defeatp then one day phe was an officerp he would have knownp heardp that lee had detached some troops and sent them down to reinforce themp perhaps he even knew the names and numbers of the regiments before they arrivedp he saw sutpenp maybe that first time sutpen actually did not see himp maybe that first time he could tell himselfp pthat was whyp he didnpt see mepp so that he had to put himself in sutpenps wayp make his chance and situationp then for the second time he looked at the expressionless and rocklike facep at the pale boring eyes in which there was no flickerp nothingp the face in which he saw his own featuresp in which he saw recognitionp and that was allp that was allp there was nothing further nowp perhaps he just breathed once quietlyp with on his own face that expression which might at a glance have been called smiling while he thoughtp pi could force himp i could go to him and force himpp knowing that he would not because it was all finished nowp that was all of it now and at lastp and maybe it was that same night or maybe a night a week later while they were stopped pbecause even sherman would have to stop sometimes at nightp with the fires burning for warmth at least because at least warmth is cheap and doesnpt remain consumedp that bon saidp phenryp and saidp pit wont be much longer now and then there wont be anything leftp we wont even have anything to do leftp not even the privilege of walking backward slowly for a reasonp for the sake of honor and whatps left of pridep not godp evidently we have done without him for four yearsp only he just didnpt think to notify usp and not only not shoes and clothing but not even any need for themp and not only no land nor any way to make foodp but no need for the food since we have learned to live without that toop and so if you dont have god and you dont need food and clothes and shelterp there isnpt anything for honor and pride to climb on and hold to and flourishp and if you havenpt got honor and pridep then nothing mattersp only there is something in you that doesnpt care about honor and pride yet that livesp that even walks backward for a whole year just to livep that probably even when this is over and there is not even defeat leftp will still decline to sit still in the sun and diep but will be out in the woodsp moving and seeking where just will and endurance could not move itp grubbing for roots and such p the old mindless sentient undreaming meat that doesnpt even know any difference between despair and victoryp henrypp and then henry would begin to say pthank godp thank godp panting and saying pthank godpp sayingp pdont try to explain itp just do itp and bonp pyou authorise mep as her brother you give me permissionpp and henryp pbrotherp brotherp you are the oldestp why do you ask mepp and bonp pnop he has never acknowledged mep he just warned mep you are the brother and the sonp do i have your permissionp henrypp and henryp pwritep writep writepp so bon wrote the letterp after the four yearsp and henry read it and sent it offp but they didnpt quit then and follow the letterp they still walked backwardp slow and stubbornp listening toward the north for the end of it because it takes an awful lot of character to quit anything when you are losingp and they had been walking backward slow for a year now so all they had left was not the will but just the abilityp the grooved habit to endurep then one night they had stopped again since sherman had stopped againp and an orderly came along the bivouac line and found henry at last and saidp psutpenp the colonel wants you in his tentppp pand so you and the old damep the aunt rosap went out there that night and the old nigger clytie tried to stop youp stop herp she held your arm and saidp pdont let her go up therep young marsterp but you couldnpt stop her either because she was strong with fortypthree years of hate like fortypthree years of raw meat and all clytie had was just fortypfive or fifty years of despair and waitingp and youp you didnpt even want to be there at all to begin withp and you couldnpt stop her either and then you saw that clytieps trouble wasnpt anger nor even distrustp it was terrorp fearp and she didnpt tell you in so many words because she was still keeping that secret for the sake of the man who had been her father too as well as for the sake of the family which no longer existedp whose hereptopfore inviolate and rotten mausoleum she still guardedp p didnpt tell you in so many words anymore than she told you in so many words how she had been in the room that day when they brought bonps body in and judith took from his pocket the metal case she had given him with her picture in itp she didnpt tell youp it just came out of the terror and the fear after she turned you loose and caught the aunt rosaps arm and the aunt rosa turned and struck her hand away and went on to the stairs and clytie ran at her again and this time the aunt rosa stopped and turned on the second step and knocked clytie down with her fist like a man would and turned and went on up the stairsp and clytie lay there on the floorp more than eighty years old and not much more than five feet tall and looking like a little bundle of clean rags so that you went and took her arm and helped her up and her arm felt like a stickp as light and dry and brittle as a stickp and she looked at you and you saw it was not rage but terrorp and not nigger terror because it was not about herself but was about whatever it was that was up stairsp that she had kept hidden up there for almost four yearsp and she didnpt tell you in the actual words because even in the terror she kept the secretp nevertheless she told youp or at least all of a sudden you knew p  p p he ceased againp it was just as wellp since he had no listenerp perhaps he was aware of itp then suddenly he had no talker eitherp though possibly he was not aware of thisp because now neither of them was therep they were both in carolina and the time was fortypsix years agop and it was not even four now but compounded still furtherp since now both of them were henry sutpen and both of them were bonp compounded each of both yet either neitherp smelling the very smoke which had blown and faded away fortypsix years ago from the bivouac fires burning in a pine grovep the gaunt and ragged men sitting or lying about themp talking not about the war yet all curiously enough por perhaps not curiously at allp facing the south where further on in the darkness the pickets stood p the pickets whop watching to the southp could see the flicker and gleam of the federal bivouac fires myriad and faint and encircling half the horizon and counting ten fires for each confederate onep and between whom and which prebel picket and yankee firep the yankee

exchangep though they would presently hear the orderly plainly enough as he passes from fire to firep asking for sutpen and being directed on and so reaches the fire at lastp the smoldering logp with his monotonous speechp psutpenp ipm looking for sutpenp until henry sits up and saysp pherepp he is gaunt and ragged and unshavenp because of the last four years and because he had not quite got his height when the four years beganp he is not as tall by two inches as he gave promise of beingp and not as heavy by thirty pounds as he probably will be a few years after he has outlived the four yearsp if he do outlive themp  p herep he saysp p what is itp  p the colonel wants youp the orderly does not return with himp insteadp he walks alone through the darkness along a rutted roadp a road rutted and cut and churned where the guns have passed over it that afternoonp and reaches the tent at lastp one of the few tentsp the canvas wall gleaming faintly from a candle withinp the silhouette of a sentry before itp who challenges himp  p sutpenp henry saysp p the colonel sent for mep the sentry gestures him into the tentp he stoops through the entrancep the canvas falls behind him as someonep the only occupant of the tentp rises from a camp chair behind the table on which the candle sitsp his shadow swooping high and huge up the canvas wallp he phenryp comes to salute facing a gray sleeve with colonelps braid on itp one bearded cheekp a jutting nosep a shaggy droop of ironpriddled hair p a face which henry does not recognisep not because he has not seen it in four years and does not expect to see it here and nowp but rather because he is not looking at itp he just salutes the braided cuff and stands so until the other saysp  p henryp even now henry does not startp he just stands sop the two of them stand sop looking at one anotherp it is the older man who moves firstp though they meet in the center of the tentp where they embrace and kiss before henry is aware that he has movedp was going to movep moved by what of close blood which in the reflex instant arrogates and reconciles even though it does not yet pperhaps never willp forgivep who stands now while his father holds his face between both handsp looking at itp  p henryp sutpen saysp p my sonp then they sitp one on either side of the tablep in the chairs reserved for officersp the table pan open map lies on itp and the candle between themp  p you were hit at shilohp colonel willow tells mep sutpen saysp  p yesp sirp henry saysp he is about to say charles carried me back but he does notp because already he knows what is comingp he does not even think surely judith didnpt write him about that letter or it was clytie who sent him word somehow that charles has written herp he thinks neither of thesep to him it is logical and natural that their father should know of his and bonps decisionp that rapport of blood which should bring bon to decide to writep himself to agree to it and their father to know of it at the same identical instantp after a period of four yearsp out of all timep now it does comep almost exactly as he has known that it willp  p i have seen charles bonp henryp henry says nothingp it is coming nowp he says nothingp he merely stares at his father p the two of them in leafpfaded grayp a single candlep a crude tent walling them away from a darkness where alert pickets face one another and where weary men sleep without shelterp waiting for dawn and the firingp the weary backward walking to commence againp yet in a second tent candle gray and all are gone and it is the hollypdecked christmas library at sutpenps hundred four years ago and the table not a camp table suitable for the spreading of maps but the heavy carved rosewood one at home with the group photograph of his mother and sister and himself sitting upon itp his father behind the table and behind his father the window above the garden where judith and bon strolled in that slow rhythm where the heart matches the footsteps and the eyes need only look at one anotherp  p you are going to let him marry judithp henryp still henry does not answerp it has all been said beforep and now he has had four years of bitter struggle following whichp whether it be victory or defeat which he has gainedp at least he has gained it and has peace nowp even if the peace be mostly despairp  p he cannot marry herp henryp now henry speaksp  p you said that beforep i told you thenp and nowp and now it wont be much longer now and then we wont have anything leftp honor nor pride nor god since god quit us four years ago only he never thought it necessary to tell usp no shoes nor clothes and no need for themp not only no land to make food out of but no need for the food and when you dont have god and honor and pridep nothing matters except that there is the old mindless meat that dont even care if it was defeat or victoryp that wont even diep that will be out in the woods and fieldsp grubbing up roots and weedsp p yesp i have decidedp brother or notp i have decidedp i willp i willp  p he must not marry herp henryp  p yesp i said yes at firstp but i was not decided thenp i didnpt

was not until after he was born that i found out that his mother was part negrop nor did henry ever say that he did not remember leaving the tentp he remembers all of itp he remembers stooping through the entrance again and passing the sentry againp he remembers walking back down the cut and rutted roadp stumbling in the dark among the ruts on either side of which the fires have now died to embersp so that he can barely distinguish the men sleeping on the earth about themp it must be better than eleven oclockp he thinksp and another eight miles tomorrowp if it were only not for those damned gunsp why doesnpt old joe give the guns to shermanp then we could make twenty miles a dayp we could join lee thenp at least lee stops and fights some of the timep he remembers itp he remembers how he did not return to his fire but stopped presently in a lonely place and leaned against a pinep leaning quietly and easilyp with his head back so he could look up at the shabby shaggy branches like something in wrought iron spreading motionless against the chill vivid stars of early springp thinking i hope he remembers to thank colonel willow for letting us use his tentp thinking not what he would do but what he would have to dop because he knew what he would dop it now depended on what bon would dop would force him to dop since he knew that he would do itp so i must go to himp he thoughtp thinkingp now it is better than two oclock and it will be dawn soonp then it was dawnp or almostp and it was coldp a chill which struck through the worn patched thin clothingp through the something of weariness and undernourishmentp the passive abilityp not the volitional willp to endurep there was light somewherep enough of it for him to distinguish bonps sleeping face from among the others where he lay wrapped in his blanketsp beneath his spread cloakp enough light for him to wake bon by and for bon to distinguish his face por perhaps something communicated by henryps handp because bon does not speakp demand to know who it isp he merely rises and puts the cloak about his shoulders and approaches the smoldering fire and is kicking it into a blaze when henry speaksp  p waitp bon pauses and looks at henryp now he can see henryps facep he saysp  p you will be coldp you are cold nowp you havenpt been asleepp have youp herep he swings the cloak from his shoulders and holds it outp  p nop henry saysp  p yesp take itp ipll get my blanketp bon puts the cloak about henry and goes and takes up his tumbled blanket and swings it about his shouldersp and they move aside and sit on a logp now it is dawnp the east is grayp it will be primrose soon and then red with firing and once more the weary backward marching will beginp retreating from annihilationp falling back upon defeatp though not quite yetp there will be a little time yet for them to sit side by side upon the log in the making light of dawnp the one in the cloakp the other in the blanketp their voices

hoovesp might even see at any moment now the black stallion and the rider rush across the road before them and gallop on p the rider who at one time ownedp lock stock and barrelp everything he could see from a given pointp with every stick and blade and hoof and heel on it to remind him pif he ever forgot itp that he was the biggest thing in their sight and in his own toop who went to war to

furnacepbreath of air in which they moved seemed to reek in slow and protracted violence with a smell of desolation and decay as if the wood of which it was built were fleshp she was trotting beside

carefully since he did not know just where the floor planks might be rotten or even missingp until he came to a windowp the shutters were closed and apparently lockedp yet they gave almost at once to the blade of the hatchetp making not very much sound p a flimsy and sloven barricading done either by an old feeble person p woman p or by a shiftless manp he had already inserted the hatchet blade beneath the sash before he discovered that there was no glass in itp that all he had to do now was to step through the vacant framep then he stood there for a momentp telling himself to go on inp telling himself that he was not afraidp he just didnpt want to know what might be insidep pwellpp miss coldfield whispered from the doorp phave you opened itpp pyespp he saidp he did not whisperp though he did not speak overloudp the dark room which he faced repeated his voice with hollow profundityp as an unfurnished room willp pyou wait therep ipll see if i can open the doorpp p pso now i shall have to go inpp he thoughtp climbing over the sillp he knew that the room was emptyp the echo of his voice had told him thatp yet he moved as slowly and carefully here as he had along the galleryp feeling along the wall with his handp following the wall when it turnedp and found the door and passed through itp he would be in the hall nowp he almost believed that he could hear miss coldfield breathing just beyond the wall beside himp it was pitch darkp he could not seep he knew that he could not seep yet he found that his eyelids and muscles were aching with strain while merging and dissolving red spots wheeled and vanished across the retinaep he went onp he felt the door under his hand at last and now he could hear miss coldfieldps whimpering breathing beyond it as he fumbled for the lockp then behind him the sound of the scraped match was like an explosionp a pistolp even before the puny following light appeared all his organs lifted sickeninglyp he could not even move for a moment even though something of sanity roared silently inside his skullp pitps all rightp if it were dangerp he would not have struck the matchpp then he could movep and turned to see the tiny gnomelike creature in headrag and voluminous skirtsp the worn coffeepcolored face staring at himp the match held in one coffeepcolored and dollplike hand above her headp then he was not watching her but watching the match as it burned down toward her fingersp he watched quietly as she moved at last and lit a second match from the first and turnedp he saw then the squarepended saw chunk beside the wall and the lamp sitting upon it as she lifted the chimney and held the match to the wickp he remembered itp lying here in the massachusetts bed and breathing fast nowp now that peace and quiet had fled againp he remembered how she did not say one word to himp not who are youp or what do you want herep but merely came with a bunch of enormous old fashioned iron keysp as if she had known all the time that this hour must come and that it could not be resistedp and opened the door and stepped back a little as miss coldfield enteredp and how she pclytiep and miss coldfield said no word to one anotherp as if clytie had looked once at the other woman and knew that that would do no goodp that it was to himp quentinp that she turnedp putting her hand on his arm and sayingp pdont let her go up therep young marsterpp and how maybe she looked at him and knew that would do no good eitherp because she turned and overtook miss coldfield and caught her arm and saidp pdont you go up therep rosiep and miss coldfield struck the hand away and went on toward the stairs pand now he saw that she had a flashlightp he remembered how he thoughtp pit must have been in the umbrella too along with the axepp and clytie saidp prosiep and ran after the other againp whereupon miss coldfield turned on the step and struck clytie to the floor with a fullparmed blow like a man would havep and turned and went on up the stairsp she pclytiep lay on the bare floor of the scaling and empty hall like a small shapeless bundle of quiet clean ragsp when he reached her he saw that she was quite consciousp her eyes wide open and calmp he stood above herp thinkingp pyesp she is the one who owns the terrorpp when he raised her it was like picking up a handful of sticks concealed in a rag bundlep so light she wasp she could not standp he had to hold her upp aware of some feeble movement or intention in her limbs until he realised that she was trying to sit on the bottom stepp he lowered her to itp pwho are youpp she saidp pipm quentin compsonpp he answeredp pyesp i remember your grandpawp you go up there and make her come downp make her go away from herep whatever he donep me and judith and him have paid it outp you go and get herp take her away from herepp so he mounted the stairsp the worn bare treadsp the cracked and scaling wall on one sidep the balustrade with its intermittent missing spindles on the otherp he remembered how he looked back and she was still sitting as he had left herp and that now pand he had not heard him enterp there stood in the hall below a hulking young lightpcolored negro man in clean faded overalls and shirtp his arms danglingp no surprisep no nothing in the saddlepcolored and slackpmouthed idiot facep he remembered how he thoughtp pthe scionp the heirp the apparent pthough not obviouspp and how he heard miss coldfieldps feet and saw the light of the torch approaching along the upper hall and how she came and passed himp how she stumbled a little and caught herself and looked full at him as if she had never seen him before p the eyes wide and unseeing like a sleepwalkerpsp the face which had always been tallowphued now possessing some still profounderp some almost unbearablep quality of bloodlessness p and he thoughtp pwhatp what is it nowp itps not shockp and it never has been fearp can it be triumphpp and how she passed him and went onp he heard clytie say to the manp ptake her to the gatep the buggyp and he stood there thinkingp pi should go with herp and thenp pbut i must see too nowp i will have top maybe i shall be sorry tomorrowp but i must seepp so when he came back down the stairs pand he remembered how he thoughtp pmaybe my face looks like hers didp but itps not triumphpp there was only clytie in the hallp sitting still on the bottom stepp sitting still in the attitude in which he had left herp she did not even look at him when he passed herp nor did he overtake miss coldfield and the negrop it was too dark to go fastp though he could presently hear them ahead of himp she was not using the flashlight nowp he remembered how he thoughtp psurely she cant be afraid to show a light nowpp but she was not using it and he wondered if she were holding to the negrops arm nowp he wondered that until he heard the negrops voicep flatp without emphasis or interestp pwawkin better over herep and no answer from herp though he was close enough now to hear por believe he didp her whimpering panting breathp then he heard the other sound and he knew that she had stumbled and fallenp he could almost see the hulking slackpfaced negro stopped in his tracksp looking toward the sound of the fallp waitingp without interest or curiosityp as he pquentinp hurried forwardp hurried toward the voicesp pyoup niggerp whatps your namepp pcalls me jim bondpp phelp me upp you aint any sutpenp you dont have to leave me lying in the dirtpp when he stopped the buggy at her gate she did not offer to get out alone this timep she sat there until he got down and came around to her sidep she still sat therep clutching the umbrella in one hand and the hatchet in the otherp until he spoke her namep then she stirredp he helpedp lifted her downp she was almost as light as clytie had beenp when she moved it was like a mechanical dollp so that he supported and led her through the gate and up the short walk and into the dollpsized house and turned on the light for her and looked at the fixed sleeppwalking facep the wide dark eyes as she stood therep still clutching the umbrella and the hatchetp the shawl and the black dress both stained with dirt where she had fallenp the black bonnet jerked forward and awry by the shock of the fallp pare you all right nowpp he saidp pyespp she saidp pyesp ipm all rightp goodnightpp p pnot thank youpp he thoughtp pjust goodnightpp outside the house nowp breathing deep and fast now as he returned to the buggyp finding that he was about to begin to runp thinking

darkness and the almost dried shirt still clutched in his handp he said pi have been asleepp it was all the samep there was no differencep waking or sleeping he walked down that upper hall between the scaling walls and beneath the cracked ceilingp toward the faint light which fell outward from the last door and paused therep saying pnop nop and then ponly i mustp i have top and went inp entered the bare stale room whose shutters were closed toop where a second lamp burned dimly on a crude tablep waking or sleeping it was the samep the bedp the yellow sheets and pillowp the wasted yellow face

even though the reason for it would not have seemed to bep and the deputy and the driver would spring out and miss coldfield would stumble out and follow themp running toop onto the gallery toop where

but they couldnpt catch himp they could hear himp he didnpt seem to ever get any further away but they couldnpt get any nearer and maybe in time they could not even locate the direction of the howling anymorep they p the driver and the deputy p held miss coldfield as she struggledp he pquentinp could see herp themp he had not been there but he could see herp struggling and fighting like a doll in a nightmarep making no soundp foaming a little at the mouthp her face even in the sunlight lit by one last wild crimson reflection as the house collapsed and roared awayp and there was only the sound of the idiot negro leftp pand so it was the aunt rosa that came back to town inside the ambulancepp shreve saidp quentin did not answerp he did not even sayp miss rosap he just lay there staring at the window without even blinkingp breathing the chill heady pure snowgleamed darknessp pand she went to bed because it was all finished nowp there was nothing left nowp nothing out there now but that idiot boy to lurk around those ashes and those four gutted chimneys and howl until someone came and drove him awayp they couldnpt catch him and nobody ever seemed to make him go very far awayp he just stopped howling for a little whilep then after a while they would begin to hear him againp and so she diedpp quentin did not answerp staring at the windowp then he could not tell if it was the actual window or the windowps pale rectangle upon his eyelidsp though after a moment it began to emergep it began to take shape in its same curiousp lightp gravitypdefying attitude p the oncepfolded sheet out of the wistaria mississippi summerp the cigar smellp the random blowing of the firefliesp pthe southpp shreve saidp pthe southp jesusp no wonder you folks all outlive yourselves by years and years and yearspp it was becoming quite distinctp he would be able to decipher the words soonp in a momentp even almost nowp nowp nowp pi am older at twenty than a lot of people who have diedpp quentin saidp pand more people have died than have been twentyponepp shreve saidp now he pquentinp could read itp could finish it p the sloped whimsical ironic hand out of mississippi attenuatedp into the iron snowp  p or perhaps there isp surely it can harm no one to believe that perhaps she has escaped not at all the privilege of being outraged and amazed and of not forgiving but on the contrary has herself gained that place or bourne where the objects of the outrage and of the commiseration also are no longer ghosts but are actual people to be actual recipients of the hatred and the pityp it will do no harm to hope p you see i have written hopep not thinkp so let it be hopep p that the one cannot escape the censure which no doubt he deservesp that the other no longer lack the commiseration which let us hope pwhile we are hopingp that they have longed forp if only for the reason that they are about to receive it whether they will or nop the weather was beautiful though cold and they had to use picks to break the earth for the grave yet in one of the deeper clods i saw a redworm doubtless alive when the clod was thrown up though by afternoon it was frozen againp pso it took charles bon and his mother to get rid of old tomp and charles bon and the octoroon to get rid of judithp and charles bon and clytie to get rid of henryp and charles bonps mother and charles bonps grandmother got rid of charles bonp so it takes two niggers to get rid of one sutpenp dont itpp quentin did not answerp evidently shreve did not want an answer nowp he continued almost without a pausep pwhich is all rightp itps finep it clears the whole ledgerp you can tear all the pages out and burn themp except for one thingp and do you know what that ispp perhaps he hoped for an answer this timep or perhaps he merely paused for emphasisp since he got no answerp pyoupve got one nigger leftp one nigger sutpen leftp of course you cant catch him and you dont even always see him and you never will be able to use himp but youpve got him there stillp you still hear him at night sometimesp dont youpp pyespp quentin saidp pand so do you know what i thinkpp now he did expect an answerp and now he got onep pnopp quentin saidp pdo you want to know what i thinkpp pnopp quentin saidp pthen ipll tell youp i think that in time the jim bonds are going to conquer the western hemispherep of course it wont quite be in our time and of course as they spread toward the poles they will bleach out again like the rabbits and the birds dop so they wont show up so sharp against the snowp but it will still be jim bondp and so in a few thousand yearsp i who regard you will also have sprung from the loins of african kingsp now i want you to tell me just one thing morep why do you hate the southpp pi donpt hate itpp quentin saidp quicklyp at oncep immediatelyp pi dont hate itpp he saidp i donpt hate it he thoughtp panting in the cold airp the iron new england darkp i dontp i dontp i
