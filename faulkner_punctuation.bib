"Backgrounds and Contexts" highlights contemporary reception of the novel, Faulkner's early versions of the saga, and his own commentary upon it. The "Historical Contexts" section provides readers with essential information on race and class relations in the story's locales (Mississippi, Haiti, Virginia and New Orleans), Chickasaw dispossession, the Civil War home front, as well as on how the plantation past was memorialized. In the "Criticism" section, scholars share analyses which examine questions of narrative method and media, as well as themes of race, gender, sexuality, illness, geography and capitalism in the text. A selected biography and chronology are also included"--},

Although an exact F statistic can be used for testing whether any specified unit is an outlier with respect to its value of {$\beta$}, in general the degrees of freedom differ between units so transformation to the same distribution is necessary in order to find the extreme value for testing for an outlier in any unit. Two transformations of F to standard normal are found to work well. Transformation to a completely specified distribution implies that the problems of masking and swamping do not arise in this problem. The power of one common outlier test is examined by simulation and the procedure is illustrated on a set of rainfall data.},

Along with traditional evidence about the composition of Maisie, they also show that methods that are very effective in identifying even subtle stylistic variations show no significant stylistic changes within Maisie that can be reasonably linked with the process of dictation.},

It shows information about the location, spread, skewness as well as the tails of the data. However, when the data are skewed, usually many points exceed the whiskers and are often erroneously declared as outliers. An adjustment of the boxplot is presented that includes a robust measure of skewness in the determination of the whiskers. This results in a more accurate representation of the data and of possible outliers. Consequently, this adjusted boxplot can also be used as a fast and automatic outlier detection tool without making any parametric assumption about the distribution of the bulk of the data. Several examples and simulation results show the advantages of this new procedure.},

Instability constitutive of a society in economic crisis is transferred to the novel's character system, one that sees instability and violence as the effects of a fanaticism deriving from flawed character, rather than from class struggles inflamed by socioeconomic catastrophe. For the novel's aesthetics to cohere, the Depression, in numerous particulars --- from the political economy of the South to details about the lumber industry --- had to be obscured or erased. These particulars would otherwise disable the anti-radical politics embedded in the character system, a paradigm in which social change is brought about naturally and gradually by the "best whites," politically moderate native southerners, assisted by the "best blacks."},

He shows that traditional approaches to these devices tend to describe the features of written language exclusively by analogy to those of spoken language, with the result that punctuation has been regarded as an unsystematic and deficient means for presenting spoken-language intonation. Analysed in its own terms, however, punctuation manifests a coherent linguistic subsystem of 'text-grammar' that coexists in writing with the system of 'lexical grammar' that has been the traditional object of linguistic inquiry. A detailed analysis of the category structure of English text-sentences reveals a highly systematic set of syntactic and presentational rules that can be described in terms independent of the rules of lexical grammar and are largely matters of the tacit knowledge that writers acquire without formal instruction. That these rules obey constraints that are structurally analogous to those of lexical grammar leads Nunberg to label the text-grammar an 'application' of the principles of natural language organization to a new domain. Geoffrey Nunberg is a researcher at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.},

This paper responds to such claims, arguing against the common belief that Faulkner's writing is made up of an inscrutable verbal style. Instead, Faulkner's unique prose style is an attempt to evoke the metaphorical lost landscapes of the past. I use Martin Heidegger's work here: he claims the language of poetry has the potential to bring meaning into existence. I also rely on Maurice Merleau-Ponty, who argues that language is not merely a signifier, but that it brings meaning and creates a new dimension to human existence. Applying these theories to Faulkner's As I Lay Dying, I argue that language is not inadequate, but rather a regenerative illusion; that Faulkner uses language to create a spiraling, looping narrative string, entwining past and present in the language of poetry.},

  abstract = {Polished and refitted into a new critical matrix, these essays by a distinguished Faulkner editor and scholar in no way resemble the casual self-anthologizing often encountered. Polk's stature as a critic meshes neatly with his work as an editor; his patent joy at the very sight of Faulkner manuscripts is inspiriting, and his professed commitment to Freudian readings is borne lightly (that is, expressed in sensible, jargon-free discourse that is both witty and brilliant). --J. M. Ditsky, Choice First published in 1996, this book by a major scholar of William Faulkner's writings collects choice selections of his Faulkner criticism from the past fifteen years. Its publication underscores the significance of his indispensable work in Faulkner studies, both in criticism and in the editing of Faulkner's texts.  Here, Polk's focus is mainly upon the context of Freudian themes, expressly in the works written between 1927 and 1932, the period in which Faulkner wrote and ultimately revised Sanctuary, a novel to which Polk has given concentrated study during his distinguished career. He has connected the literature with the life in a way not achieved in previous criticism. Although other critics, notably John T. Irwin and Andre Bleikasten have explored Oedipal themes, neither perceived them as operating so completely at the center of Faulkner's work as Polk does in these essays. Noel Polk, a professor of English at the University of Southern Mississippi, is the editor of the definitive texts of Faulkner's works. He also is one of the most notable scholars of Eudora Welty's works and the author of Eudora Welty: A Bibliography of Her Work (University Press of Mississippi)},

  abstract = {An outlier is an event or observation that is defined as an unusual activity, intrusion, or a suspicious data point that lies at an irregular distance from a population. The definition of an outlier event, however, is subjective and depends on the application and the domain (agriculture, healthcare, wireless network, etc.). It is important to detect outlier events as carefully as possible to avoid infrastructure failures, because anomalous events can cause minor to severe damage to infrastructure. For instance, an attack on a cyber-physical system, such as a microgrid may initiate voltage or frequency instability, thereby damaging a smart inverter, which involves very expensive repairing. Unusual activities in microgrids can be mechanical faults, behavior changes in the system, human or instrument errors or a malicious attack. Accordingly, and due to its variability, outlier detection (OD) is an ever-growing research field. In this chapter, we discuss the progress of OD methods using AI techniques. For that, the fundamental concepts of each OD model are introduced via multiple categories. Broad range of OD methods are categorized into six major categories: statistical-based, distance-based, density-based, clustering-based, learning-based, and ensemble methods. For every category, we discuss recent state-of-the-art approaches, their application areas, and performances. After that, a brief discussion regarding the advantages, disadvantages, and challenges of each technique is provided with recommendations on future research directions. This survey aims to guide the reader to better understand recent progress of OD methods for the assurance of AI.},

From both the diachronic and synchronic perspectives, we found that the frequency distribution for English punctuation followed the laws of least effort. The study showed that there were differences in how different punctuation marks were used in different registers. The varieties of English were also found to differ with regard to the frequencies of specific punctuation marks. In the last three hundred years, the practices of punctuation marks have become more syntactical rather than rhetorical or prosodic in nature. These changes in the frequencies of punctuation marks are evident in, for instance, the shorter sentences and increase in the use of hyphenated compounds and apostrophes in contracted forms. These developments show that modern stylistic-grammatical punctuation is developing under the influence of modern writing and communication technologies.},
